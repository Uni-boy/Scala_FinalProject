10,Counter-Strike,"Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"An Old damn game, but you know, Old is Gold. It's a whole lot of fun when you play decently but sometimes irritating on pubs, Servers with limted slots, like 15, and everything unlocked, trust me, with some basic understanding of the game, it will be more enjoyable than masturbating.  **BEST THING ABOUT THE GAME** The netcode of this game is perfect, is very enjoyable and gives decent hitreg even with bad internet which gives you lag spikes upto 300ms.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,This is the best old school game I have ever played. I started it when I was about 12 years old on a BETA version and went on it for about 5 years. Definitely an epic multiplayer game...too bad it's not as active as before..I just came back to games.,1,0

10130,TimeShift,"Its above average, Not great but worht to try it.",1,0
10150,Prototype,Its mindless arcade fun where you become so powerful you can't help but behave deviously. Its a bad console port and had a memory leak that caused me to have to restart it every hour or so. Cant recommend it.,-1,0
10150,Prototype,Awesome game. Doesn't need a good computer to play.,1,0
10150,Prototype,"controls unintuitive and hard to get used to, despite the controls game play is excellent. Story is disjointed so far due to how the game is set up.   worth a play but not a full price  overall - 4/5",1,0
10150,Prototype,"It's a great game, but be warned:  -This game will likely run very slow (10 FPS) unless you know how to fix it. From what I've seen, different people have to use different fixes based on their system. I had to disable some HIDs and unplug my keyboard.  -This game is much more fun if you have a controller. Keyboard and mouse feels too clunky for this game.",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"Orc's must die and Orc's must die 2 is an addictive, fast bpaced and incredibly fun game. It's easy to pick up the game play and the UI is intuitive and well made. The Graphics and color is Awesome !! The music really sets the mode and is really cool. I would recemend this game to anyone... ( 5 out of 5 stars) BO",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"i dont know, but i didnt found something special in this game",-1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,It's tower defence on steroids. Excellent game!,1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"The orc mass murder simulator. If you are into tower defense, this mix with action and strategy is for you, it's a must buy for fans of the genre.  10/10 would headshot an orc again.",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,Cool Indie game :D 7/10 Stars *******,1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"I get why the Orcs need to die, I really do. But do they HAVE to die? The game never explains why they have to die, or why the wan't to capture the time portal's so badly. Surely their primitive hierarchy of wants and needs can be satisfied with the help of some magic. We don't even know the full story, maybe the portals are Samuri-Jack style way to the past before evil mages took over the orcis agricultural utopia that once existed before hand. We just cant know for certain and for that reason I am a consiencous objector to killing orcs as a TF2 inspired scout-mage until the developers explain why the orcs absolutely 100% MUST die.",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"I played the crap out of this game on my friends xbox 360 and loved every minute of it.  Pros: Orcs Must Die is just witty, funny, entertaining, strategy driven tower defense with a 3rd person shooter slapped on top of it, utilitizing traps to push back hordes of orcs and other monsters . This game is just great 100%.  Cons: Honestly there is no cons to this game that I find worth mentioning.  Overall: 9.9/10 because on warmaster this game is intense.",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"Worth every dollar, it can get really frustrating but it's just so much fun in the end 9/10.",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"This game runs face-first into the same problem that Sanctum did - that success relies on one correct strategy from the beginning. Not only that, but you get to upgrade your traps, and if you mess that up by putting them in the wrong areas, there's no refunds - you actually have to start a new profile.  The graphics, music, sound and concept all receive an A, but the number of flawed tower defense games on this planet are as innumerable as the stars.",1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,This is some of the most fun I've ever had playing a game.,1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,An amazingly fun and addicting fast paced third-person action game in which Orcs must die. You achieve that with your magical abilities as well as with the help of a large number of ingenious traps that you continuously get throughout the game. The difficulty and challenge gets constantly ramped up but never feels overwhelming.,1,0
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"There's just something about deploying the traps, bottlenecking the Orcs, and watching the combos fly that balances its charm between arcade tower defense and creative puzzle making. This game has kept me from jumping back on World of Warcraft...FOR THE ALLIANCE!!",1,0

104700,Super Monday Night Combat,The best moba I've ever played. (Check my profile) Underrated game.. Also no players left playing it.. Soo.. Yeah.. If you are looking for a game like this check out Motiga's Gigantic when it's released.,1,0
104700,Super Monday Night Combat,probably the most enjoyable team based 3rd person game ever. even though there isn't too many players its still active.,1,0
104700,Super Monday Night Combat,"I really hope this game dies. That sounds horrible but the game is so monotonous you do the same thing in 3 different ways over and over. It really bugs me that its a pay to win to. There are people who wasted $20 on this game and instantly kill you repeatedly. I mean at first its fun, then when you reach level 5 it gets a little boring, then at level 10 you understand why people dont play the game and respect it, then at level 15 you get really bored of the game, either quitting it or pushing through to get the stupid hat, and at level 20, where I am, YOU JUST HATE THE GAME AND WANT IT TO DIE AFTER IT GIVES YOU THE HAT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE WORTHLESS.",-1,0

105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,"Out of all honesty, for those who are thinking about getting this, ask yourself if you're willing to spend time on a game that will boggle your mind with puzzles, if you find that fun, then you need to buy this game. If you don't like puzzles and go for the plot, you can still search the walkthroughs on a website, but although you will find it less entertaining that it normally would go out as a gameplay experience. If you hate puzzles thoughout then obviously its a no-no.  Fay: The girl you play in the game, has the best plot story, although i'm almost done with it (1 chapter left) i find her character development a great balance between what the plot indicates and situational events occuring around her.  Bent: I find it difficult to understand his reasons of collaborating within the plot, first half he goes into denial, the second half he goes through reasoning and his character development doesnt change through that and when you arrive at the Labratories at the Sea you might think it is boring, and yes because our limited options prevents us from doing anything at all by that stage.  Gameplay: Crazy as it may seem I loved the gameplay, its just a few minor tweaks that may help it out, a bit of specification would be nice, and the atmosphere really does get to you when you're feeling the situation current at hand.  8.5/10",1,1
105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,"A little odd. Not entirely sure I enjoy the endless OMG LOOK HERE, CLICK THIS, TRY AND SOLVE X PUZZLE.. Gimme a little more fluidity. But I'm intrigued, and will nonetheless keep playing. Easy acheezes for this lazybum.",1,0

105420,Ms. Splosion Man,"This game can be summed up in four words: fast-paced-timed-jumps. It's well made with decent graphics, though the voice acting can be annoying.  I'm not a fan of timed jumps game and they could be rather trying in Ms. Splosion Man, so after 3 hours of torture I'm giving this game a miss.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"i got 350 hours in this game and i still cant stop playing this game. if your looking for a survival game similiar to minecraft then you found it, and only for 10 bucks!  you'll be doing your self a favor by putting this game in your library.  9/10 heavily recommend.   UPDATE*: Stopped Playing.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game boggles my mind with the sheer amount of content and replayability it has. It has really become an absolute classic in the voxel-random generated gaming world.  Great with friends. Pretty damn epic adventures. Very interesting bosses. Great sense of exploration. Amazing, albeit imbalanced, items and equipment. Dynamic world mechanics. Huge and enjoyable time sink.  Also, stop comparing it to Minecraft! Terraria took a different creative path and succeeded in making a solid original game. Terraria is focused on the gameplay and exploration, Minecraft is focused on creation and alteration.  Damn addicting game. Worth its weight in gold.",1,0
105600,Terraria,Nice concept One of the best surivial games EVER....,1,0
105600,Terraria,"It is a game of looting, killing, and patience. You start off mining and exploring, getting amazing loot, then you move into the bosses, very good fights that anyone can die to, finally you kill the last boss and you start just getting everything in the game. It takes hours of patience to get 1 item that you will only use for 10 minutes - but this part is optional - you don't need to do the grind, and of course there's cheat mods too. With 627 hours of playing I would say itis a very god game, just don't waste your life on it like me! :P",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Night 1 - Seth the Guide got restless and let the zombies in the door  Night 65 - I dropped a doll of Seth into the depths of hell by accident (on purpose), in doing so Seth was reincarnated as an angry meaty wall that tried to kill me  10/10 would sacrifice again",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is definitely one of those games in school where you only tell your closest friends, if even them, that you play. However, it is a wonderful game that I have played with my buds on for hours. There is just so much to do, and they are always adding more. My favorite thing to do is choose a character a movie or something and model my character after them, it makes it much more fun. -Papa Bear",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Buy it. It's funny and every penny is worthy.   +Nice and simple game +Lots way of building +Lots of different things (items, weapons, armor, accessories...) +Sometimes cheap +Awesome community +Sandbox style  -No classes -No character levels -Sometimes it lacks physics -No tutorial -No achievements    PROS   1. Nice and 'simple' game.  It is a nice and simple game. There's no mistery at all and the buttons are very easy to learn. Due to its simplicity you can do lots and lots of different things.   2. Ways of building things.  How am I gonna build that? Should I use dirt, rock or anything else? Should I use any ore? How is it gonna be? How is it gonna be? It's up to the player, and that's awesome.   3. Lots of different things, lots of!.  The game is very well made. There are lots and lots of items (armors, weapons, accessories, etc) and lots of different ways to 'evolve': 20 different types of ores, 18 different environments, maximum to 20 NPCs, PvP allowed, 5 possible teams, 96 different enemies, 32 pickaxes and drills, 31 axes and chainsaws, 23 hammers, at least 85 melee weapons and 63 ranged weapons and 46 magic weapons, and and almost-infinite variety of solid blocks!   4. It's cheap!  The game itself is not expensive at all. There are lots of sudden Steam Sales that make him way cheaper than it already is. Having the official Terraria is easy, anyone can have it. Not having it is just a bad excuse.   5. Awesome community  Terraria has a huge community and two huge wikis ( here  [terraria.gamepedia.com] ,  here  [terraria.wikia.com]  and  here  [www.terrariaonline.com] ). If you don't understand something or need any help you can easily search it!   6. Sandbox style!   The game is a sandbox. Which means it technically never ends!   CONS   1. No classes  Yea, there are no classes (when I say  classes  I mean mage, archer, knight, etc). Everybody is basically the same class but using different weapons, items and sometimes buffs.   2. No character levels  Due to this fact everybody has the same maximum mana and HP late game. That's awful. For example if you focus on melee or ranged type you will -almost- always have your mana at high levels because it won't be used enough, in the other hand if you focus on magic weapons the chance of running out of mana is always a constant fact.   3. Sometimes it lacks a bit of physics  What does it means? Some physics laws are kinda broken sometimes: giving the right properties most of the blocks 'float', the hydrostatic law for fluids doesn't work or huge buildings are only sustained by a thin pillar. There's no big problem at all but it reduces the realism of the game in a lot more.   4. There's no tutorial  There's no tutorial, after the main menu you're just left to survive in the server. The game itself is not hard but it has no tutorials.   5. No achievements  There are no achievements, not even inside game nor at Steam. Playing without achievements gets boring faster.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game definitely has tons of content to keep you entertained for weeks!  As well as the feature of steam servers, it's been easier than ever to play with friends!  And with expert mode, it features a new, wide array of challenges and rewards!  10/10 would r8 m8 again.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"A wonderful sandbox-rpg game providing (in my opinion) the ultimate sandbox experience compared to any other game from the genre. It's full of conent, all of which you want to explore - and it never gets boring. The only drawback is : updates to the game are really rare.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"A fun game. Quite aggravating at times, when you die at the bottom of a deep mine, you have to run all the way down again to get your stuff and as soon as you do, a centipede comes flying from the floor and killing you instantly. Tip: Stay alive! Good building game, but if you just want to build stuff, go for Minecraft. The adventure is what is best about this game: exploration, and how deep can you build a mine shaft.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Its a really fun game! You get to fool around, go mining, summon bosses. A lot of people say just buy minecraft but this game has a lot different aspects that doesn't make it better just different in a good way. BUY IT! ITS 2 BUCKS at least now... 80% off!",1,0
105600,Terraria,Worth a play if you like slow starts and constant death while learning.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Usally, if people hear the game terraria, they think a 2D version of minecraft, but let me tell you; theres a huge diffrence betwen the two. Terraria is a sandbox game that focuses on adventuring, crafting, building and making the world yours. Of course that sounds like minecraft, but does minecraft have a large amount of bosses? no. Many ores and jewels like copper, silver, ruby and topaz? nope. Does minecraft have a freakin' underworld with fortresses?! Oh wait, right. Anyway, this game is REALLY fun, iv'e played for a while and still haven't gotten board because, well, theres more things to do! don't forget, this game is multiplayer. (but its difficult to set up, thats my only complaint)  I LOVE this game and recommend it to everyone who enjoys sandbox games where you make your world.  G8 job M8 I R8 8/8",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This is a wonderful game! definitely recommend it for anyone who likes building, killing or adventuring. There's nothing I can think of that this game truly lacks. 5 stars!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game made me ejaculate so violently and explosively that i blacked out, waking up 2 weeks later with my house being robbed and my body being stripped completely bare. The only thing the robbers didnt take was my computer, so i dragged my crusty naked body over to my desk and started playing Terraria again.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Well, for the last 2-3 years i've been playing this masterpiece of a game, it has been awesome all the way through it. I cant explain it, but it gives me that urge to jump in my chair due to how good the game, and the soundtrack is (Except Crimson and Mushroom biomes) astonishing. I would give it a 9 out of 10 stars.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria... A game where the world is your canvas and the ground is your paint. Terraria is a sandbox and survival game similar to Minecraft except its 2D. It has epic boss battles, weapons, ores armour and there is so much that barely anyone can imagine! Terraria is a materpiece and is a must play. With a good character customization option, world generation, landscape and variety of many things! You might find Terraria one of the most addictive and fun games you have ever played! Try it now!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria Is The Best Game EVER. 100x Better Then Minecraft. Want Me To Prove It? Well Once The 1.3 Update Comes Out There Will Be Over 3000 Items! While Many People Say It Is Just A Rip Off Of Minecraft And Some Just Don't Play It Because It Is A 2D Sidescroller I Think Not Because There Are More Biomes,More Weapons And Better Weapons,MUCH BETTER BOSSES,Blood,Harder Mobs And Bosses,More Armor,Cool NPC's That Make Sense,More Mobs,More Blocks,Fancy Castles,Pets And Much More And You Would Need 100s of mods to even match half of the cool stuff in terraria! Also One Last Thing TREES DON'T FLOAT. There Is Even Currency In Terraria. Also DIAMOND ARMOR SUCKS IN REAL LIFE IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE Yet In Terraria Armour Makes Sense Gold Is Stronger Then Iron, Diamond Armour Dosen't Exist And So On. Teraria Is Cheaper And After A Couple Of Years People Get Bored Of Minecraft But Not Terraria I Have Been Playing Since July Of 2013 And I Still Love It And You Will Too SO GET THE DARN GAME. 'No I Won't Buy The Game' You May Say 'Well Sorry' I Would Say *Knocks you out and drags you to the computer takes wallet buys terraria and puts you in a house in the game*.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"One of the best games I've ever played and made even better when Steam started hosting servers for co-op games. I tend to play co-op with a couple of my friends on a semi-regular basis. And even if we only intend on doing 1 or 2 things. We end up doing about 10 times that and it could go on for a couple weeks.   A great game for crafting, building, fighting, exploring, and boss fights. Maybe not so great for the zombies however. One of my tops recs for my friends.  It runs pretty good on older computers as well.",1,0
105600,Terraria,this is a grhat 2D game :-),1,0
105600,Terraria,Pretty fun game enjoyed how open the world was but I would enjoy it more if it had more of a storyline or campaign. Another good feature is how often it updates-nearlly always having new features. I would recommend this game if you enjoy platforming games like the original mario or sonics and if you enjoy crafting and building things like in minecraft.  I quite enjoyed this game and would recommend giving it a try.,1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria, a great game, questioned for being a 'Minecraft copy', Honestly prefere this game, with LOADS of content from Bosses to Npc's and also the ammount of creativity. I do have the problem with, There not being a 'creative mode' cheate or gamemode, and that most of the content you can only get on hardcore Or after you beat the Wall Of Meat.

105600,Terraria,With over 250 hours played I admit that this is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever purchased. Many people compare it to a 2-d sidescrolling Minecraft-style game that is more combat and treasure oriented...  ...they are absolutely right. If you buy this game do yourself a favor and avoid looking up hints on the web and enjoy discovering the many cool aspects of Terraria.  I STRONGLY recommend this game.,1,1
105600,Terraria,10/10 would fight Moon Lord again,1,1
105600,Terraria,just started a new world played one time befor and got far i love this game but it can be i little dull at times but very replayable. once you beat wall of flesh it all gets 2x times as fun 9/10 sorry for bad spelling,1,0
105600,Terraria,This game is great. It is nothing like a Minecraft spinoff. Most of the negative reviews come from people who are too impatient to learn the game. Roleplaying and making your own story is an amazing thing to do once you have finished the game multiple times. Do recommend.,1,0
105600,Terraria,Cool! Can't add anything else about it... fabulous game!!! (without any sarcasm),1,1
105600,Terraria,An awesome game with lots to do when u think u r done and know every thing kill wall of flesh new stuff so cool ],1,0
105600,Terraria,"a lot of people call this game a 2d minecraft. trust me, it is much much more than that. actual NPCs to talk too and buy things from, boss fights, different world sizes, TONS of items, from magical ones, weapons, armor, etc. if you have the money, buy this game, you wont regret it.",1,0

105600,Terraria,Prepare to sink all of your free time into this game. Especially if you play with friends.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"I really like this game, and I still enjoy playing it. I prefer it over Minecraft, here are some reasons why. The variety of creatures/enemies is amazing, it is like there is no end to how many there are. The options during character creation. Yes, I know there are alot of options with Minecraft, but Terraria is a whole lot easier to use. My final reason is the length of gameplay, compared to Minecraft it is not as long. But then there is the sandbox section of the game. In Minecraft you can build anything, in Terraria you also can build anything. You don't even have to work for the items if you don't want to, just download an inventory editor (such as TSGE) and give yourself over 9000 of that item. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Sandbox/Adventure or just enjoys good games in general.    P.S. Also I forgot to mention that the variety of bosses in Terraria compared to the variety of bosses in Minecraft is no contest. Terraria definitely wins. Have fun and enjoy the game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,Overall a good game although it can get a bit boring if you play it a lot.,1,0

105600,Terraria,I would buy this game! It's so fun and the music is so great!,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is an amazing game for many reasons, 1, the amount of items that can change your play style to your requirements, from a simple musket to a terra blade you choose the way you want to play. Class specific armour really helps you follow that path, 2, the creative side of terraria is amazing as you have such a broad overview and the accesibility of blocks allows you to be creative straight from the start, 3, npc's are amazing, 4, there is no story but the bosses available to kill really gives you a reason to play other than getting the best gear possible, the feeling of finally being able to kill the eye of cathulu drove me to kill the brain of cathulu and so on and so forth. In conclusion its a well rounded game with many aspects to follow and i highly recommend buying this game to play by yourself or with your mates",1,0
105600,Terraria,"If you like sandbox games... terraria is one of the cheapest games and greater value for your cash. 10 USD will get you a few hunderd hours, double or triple that if you are a collector or intense builder.

105600,Terraria,"I'm a console player of this game. I have it on Playstation 3 so my review will be based on the console version of the game, which before 1.2 came out, was pretty much the same as the Personal Computer version. This game is an Action-Adventure/Sandbox game, and it's a good one at that. The concept is fairly simple to understand. You start out at the bottom and rise to the top. There's no story to it, I feel you kinda make your own story up in the game using your imagination and that's one thing out of the many that makes this game a very fun experience.  It's mainly about making your own character and starting out on a randomly generated world, you have to learn how to fend for yourself against the other inhabbitants (Zombies, Slimes, Big Eaters, etc.) To do this you must first make a place of your own to live in (using materials you find, like wood). Then once you've built a house. It's time for the real exploring to happen, you must craft better tools to learn how to live easier within the world, to do this you'll have to go through more dangerous biomes (for example; The Crimson). Once you've collected enough material you'll be able to upgrade to better weapons and armour. Then you'll be able to fight bosses like; Skeletron and The Eater Of Worlds, killing these bosses will unlock more possibilities in the game. This is basically the games concept, it's a very fun open world adventure game.   Pros -  - Fun - Big Updates  - Tons of replayability value - Affordable  Cons -  - Optimization problems (on the Personal Computer version)  It's a really good game, I've spent enough time on it to safely say this is a very good buy for 6 pounds of your money.   The score I will give this game is; 8.5/10",1,0
105600,Terraria,100000/10 would buy again,1,0
105600,Terraria,better than minecraft :D,1,1
105600,Terraria,Terraria is a very fun RPG game also very ncie grapics i would recommend to get this gave on sale cause it is worth to get terraria on sale because it is fun silly scary adventure little bit of romance of the guns dealer and nurse spoiler alert and if you like minecraft then you will love terraria I do!,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Very fun and entertaining, the graphics are 'cute' you could say, combat is awesome. in my opinion, this game is quite superior to minecraft. if you want loads of fun and tons of things to do and discover, play terraria. If you want to build? play minecraft. By far, terraria is my favorite game of all time.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"It's a good game. To put it simply, I say that. If you want it more advanced, here ya go! What I like about this game is because it's allowing you to freely build, fight, and yet survive. It's difficult in Expert. Still difficult in Normal, but by about 50% less as Expert. Bosses. How can you NOT die to these things? If you die to a zombie, you're not going to survive against the Eye of Cthulu. The world is larger than minecraft, if you set it to large. Build freely! Expand your imagination!       and best of all, if you like all of the above... Play. This. Game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I walked upon the Klouse, only discover my Klouse. Two Klouse's were in harmony. In a Klouse bond, we walked together off into the Klouse. In spiritual sync, we Klouse swam through the Great Sea of Klouse. We reached the shore of Klouse, where a Klouse raged on. Blood and Klouse were strung up on the trees. Klouse lying limp as the Klouse pecked at it's Klouse. Cannons ripped through the Klouse, only to scare off the Klouse. Bullets punctured the Klouse.....my Klouse. He stood there motionless, his last words were 'Klouse'. His Klouse fell down onto the wet and damp Klouse. I was Kloused, who could of killed my Klouse? It was none other than Klouse, it was an army of Klouse! Klouse raged through my veins and I needed to release Klouse. I tore through the Klouse, sending hurdles of Klouse alike into the air. Blood spilled onto the Klouse and they screamed. 1 Klouse later, they were Klouse. I stood there, holding my Klouse.......never to see another Klouse again.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"It's always hard to review builder games, but Terraria is more than a builder/crafter type, it's equal parts adventure. A plethora of items, worlds, scenarios and opportunities make Terraria very deep and engaging, with set goals to work towards, large bosses to combat in a unique, fun, and challenging way. There are some minor inconveniences, mostly dealing with tedium, but it has a low learning curve. Best with friends, I'd recommend it to just that: two or more people looking to play something together that isn't Minecraft, but like it, without needing a server, and freedom to create and really just 'venture out there.'",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I'm just going to make this clear from the start, I do not enjoy/like this game. However, I do think the game is GOOD, I just don't LIKE it. 'but WHAT?!?!? you dont LIKE it but you think its GOOD?!!? how!!!!????' well, I'll explain.  Lets start with why I think its GOOD, its aesthetically pleasing, the music is awesome, and its just a well made sandbox game in general. And theres alot of content in the game no question. Hower, for some odd reason, I cannot find enjoyment through playing the game, I have nearly half a day playing it and I think that should easily be enough time to give it a 'fair chance' I've played it alone and with friends, yet I just cant find it fun. I wish I could, I wish I could understand why my friends enjoy it so much but I guess its just not for me.  In the end, I do reccomend this game because it appeals to almost anyone, and I really think it was made well. I reccomend it to anyone thinking about buying it.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"This is honestly, one of the best games on the steam store. No Joke. If you really want a game that is full of content but no $60, this is the game for you. Best $10 I've spent on a game.",1,0

Whether you be a rainbow-firing mage, or a pumpkin-firing ranger, they are all very appealing and (most of the time) balanced.  This game is filled with so much content to the point where it can actually be overwhelming at times. I, having played for many, many hours, Steam and otherwise, STILL discovering new content to this day. And who knows what will be added in future releases of the title?  10/10",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Kyle and Jessica were fooling around in her bed room and things got real hot, real fast. Kyle started moving his way down kissing every inch of Jessica's body. He reached her collar bone and she felt herself starting to get wet. She rubbed Kyle's body until she reached his jeans. She unbuttoned them and ripped them off. She flipped him over straddling his half naked body and ripped off her shirt exposing her glorious breasts unbound by a bra. 'I want to ♥♥♥♥ you so much Jess, let me ♥♥♥♥ you harder than anyone ever has.' Jessica gave him a naughty smile and shimmied down his body until her mouth reached his rock hard 8 inch ♥♥♥♥. She licked his ♥♥♥♥ from head to base and then took it all in deepthroating until she could barely breathe. Kyle had never felt anything so good in his entire life. He could feel himself about to ♥♥♥ but held back and pushed Jessica off his ♥♥♥♥. He pinned her down and shallow ♥♥♥♥ed her just to tease. 'Come on baby, you said you wanted to ♥♥♥♥ me, so do it! ♥♥♥♥ me hard! Stick it in me baby I can't stand it anymore!!!' Kyle rammed is ♥♥♥♥ in her and watched her chest bounce with every thrust. He rubbed her ♥♥♥♥ until she came all over. She screamed in pleasure and craved more. Hearing her scream for him made Kyle so hot and he let his massive load fill Jessica up. He pulled out and Jessica struck her fingers in her hot ♥♥♥♥♥ and then to her mouth to taste his ♥♥♥. She gave him head again and he exploded in her mouth. She swallowed every drop but had to have more. They started to ♥♥♥♥ again but Kyle had to have some of Jessica. He licked and sucked on her ♥♥♥♥ and then tongue ♥♥♥♥ed her until she came. 'Baby I need to have you inside me. I can't wait anymore!' Jessica's phone rang and it was her friend Mel. Mel heard how hot Jessica sounded and rushed right over. Mel joined in and Jessica ate her out. Kyle was in awe of what was going on and started to jack off. He came all over Mel's face and then ♥♥♥♥ed Jessica in the ♥♥♥ while she was still eating Mel out. Mel and Kyle came for Jessica at the same time and Jessica felt amazing. Mel and Jessica went down on Kyle and sucked him off at the same time. The three continued making each other ♥♥♥ all night until there was no more ♥♥♥ to go around. They fell asleep with Mel and Jessica in 69 and Kyle's ♥♥♥♥ in Mel's ♥♥♥.",1,1

105600,Terraria,Ive played Terraria on the Console and Mobile and I have best premode gear for console which took me several days of sitting in a room as the hours pass by loving it. Ive already played 6 hours on PC and I love it more then Console and Mobile. For 1 it has more items such as fishing poles and bug nets. The worlds are at least 10 times larger then a Console Large world or Mobile world is. Ive traveled probbaly to what would be the edge of the world on consoles and theres still more to explore! It has a pre-hardmode and hardmode with bosses for each mode and your characters transfer across other worlds. So if you have a character that can get to places fast and you want to explore a new world for items you can do jsut that. This is the best game I've played since Minecraft and I highly recomend it to any fans of Minecraft and an amazing game. The more you get into it the better it gets with better weapons and armor and SO much more to do!,1,0

105600,Terraria,pretty good with alot of items for the price,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Played for hours and hours, Terreria is that type of game you where always have something to do.  At first poeple compared it to a 2D Minecraft but now it's completely gone, we even talk about terraria-like just to point out how inovative that game was. If you're hesitant about buying this gam don't hesitate just buy it. It's freaking good and there is an amazing amount of content. While this gam is perfectly playable and enjoyable in solo, it's in multiplayer that you will enjoy this game the most.  As for the gameplay, it's a platformer action-rpg sandbox. Jumps and movement aren't really tight but they are in coherence with the rest of the game. Crafting is simple and yet really enjoyable because creating your new gear with fresh loot is always a pleasure and have cosmetic effects which gives a good feedback.  Enemies are good but the bosses are what makes this game even better. There are many different bosses with different loot and different gear you can get, all with different strategies.  Graphics are in the 16-era wich is great for me because I love pixel graphics and anyway Terraria is not game you play for it's amazing graphics, they are here and do the job, it's colorful and pretty, there are particles and other things who make the game really.   The music is pretty common, there won't be a theme that you'll want to listen over and over but they do the job, if your outside, music will be happy and simple or scary and gloomy when you dig.  What Terraria is a bit lacking is the construction and creative part but this is a choice of the developers to a more action packed game that a creative one and it works well. But don't worry there is still ways to be creative, I'm just saying that it's cmparable to Minecraft.  Now what I have to say is that Terraria should in everyones Steam Library. It's a no brain buy on Steam and it's awfully cheap for the number of hours you'll sink into it sale or not.  8/10",1,0

The game features exploration, crafting, construction, and combat with a variety of creatures in a randomly generated 2D world.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Has many parallels to Minecraft, but alot more action.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a RPG where the goal appears to be to dig the deepest hole, a shaft straight down to hell (known by players of the game as a Hellevator). There are secondary objectives in the game, such as collecting items to craft weapon, armour and new mining tools with, building houses so that NPC move in, exploring several different biomes and defeating bosses; but none of that is important compared to the Hellevator.  Once you’ve build the tunnel, fought your way past monsters, water flooding your shaft and lava blocking you way; you will arrive in the in-game version of Hell. After this, though there is the secondary quests in the game, but they really don’t matter; who wants to explore a world fighting monsters and collecting items when you can start a band new world and build another Hellevator, this time adding a tower to the top of the sky.  Terraria is a rather enjoyable game, though it can steal hours of your time if you deviate from building a Hellevator (which already takes a long time) and start building a home (at first it starts small, but then you’re building a huge castle and collecting items in order to craft nice things to go in the many rooms of the castle so that NPC will come to your city sized castle) and exploring the world!  The bosses are hard and scare me.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"While Terraria shares much of the draw of Minecraft - digging, exploring, building - it also features a wide variety of weapons, enemies and bosses. It is very much more a progression-based RPG than Minecraft. It takes more resources to build your gear, but your gear doesn't wear out and there's a lot more of it.  Being entirely in 2D gives it some advantages. For one you can see a little ways 'into' walls and the ground, but the biggest disadvantage is you can only build 2D structures which feels a tiny bit limiting in that respect. All in all, a game I've sunk hundreds of hours into and for the price tag is one of the best buys I've ever made.",1,0
105600,Terraria,It is an epic game and i recommend for ages 6+ and i use to be obsessed with minecraft but now this game in my opinion is a heck of a lot better.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a shameless 2D rip-off of Minecraft that compensates for its lack of originality by throwing mountains of content at the player... and, like some of the greatest 16-bit classics, being an obvious clone doesn't stop it from being a great game. Terraria feels less coherent as a whole than Minecraft (probably unavoidable considering just how much disparate content Re-Logic has crammed into the game), but it's just as fun.",1,0

With a group of friends, this game is even much more better you will enjoy seeing your friends drop to death, killed by zombies/vikings and even melt to lava. Overall a great game that is worth the price.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I absolutly love this game, When I first played it, it was on the Ps3. And then I bought it for the computer! This game is so much fun, it's like minecraft in the aspect of building your house, along with NPC homes. And the mineing for stuff like differnt ores to make armour with.  But, that game has waaaaaayyyyy more stuff to kill, bosses to fight, places to explore, and random loot to find! There is a lot of places to go in this game, and the maps are pretty much random. So you'll never know what you'll get or find exploreing.  I find most of my game play is exploreing for loot. You never know what you'll find when you pop open a chest, and take a peek inside.  So, If you play minecraft, and like playing more aggresivly, Like killing monsters and exploreing, Not building. Try this game!",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a retro-styled game in which your quest to become a demigod is poised with many twists and turns. And, with the newest update, there are more things to fight. The best things about this game are the epic, fast-paced battles with bosses, Pirates, goblin armies, and strange wall-sized enemies that take you into a new, much more challenging game mode.  In order to survive, you must be on your toes constantly; every nook and cranny could hold some unimagined foe. Every weapon you find and create are the key to your progress.  As a person who owns all three versions--console, mobile, and PC--I will definetly recommend this game to whomever is looking for a creative, intense, and purely costomizable game.  10/10 Would Slime again!",1,0

105600,Terraria,"This is quite a fun game to play, out of complete honesty. Lots of items so that you can discover new things, many enemies, bosses, NPC's, blocks, etc.  The main problem I have with this game is probably the endgame; While you CAN try out some different play-styles, it can get pretty repetetive  The main pro of this game (for me) is probably the discovery. There is so much to see in a world, you probably won't even get to it all.  Another main con is probably the multiplayer Hamachi thing. For those who don't know, you need a program called Hamachi in order to run a multiplayer server, or to even play on one. This isn't much of a problem, but it can get pretty annoying  My recommendation: 9.5/10",1,0
105600,Terraria,After playing Minecraft for over 2 years I decided to buy this game. I must say this is how minecraft should have been more like in its survival mode. At first the game seems prety straight forward and easy to play; but it gets more and more complex as you go. Sure you can build stuff and gather materials in it but the main point is to progress and get stronger by defeating new mobs and bosses.   Terraria: A simple game with really complex things that like an iceberg lurk beneath the surface. And uncovering them is part of the greatests joys here.  9.5/10,1,0

What more can you ask for? Its only a $10 game when its not on sale.

If you are looking for a great 2D platform adventure with many bosses then this is the game for you. I f you are looking for a great sandbox then this is the game for you. If you're looking for a great open world game then this is the game for you. Ok I think I've made my point now just hurry up and get Terraria!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,0

105600,Terraria,"“Terraria is 2D Minecraft.” That’s something that a lot of people say, and it’s a simple analogy to introduce you to the idea of the game. In a way, the two games do share some similarities, such as the blocky style, digging and placing materials, some sort of crafting system, but at this point, Terraria has long since been fleshed out as its own game.  I don’t think many people would really fault me for claiming Minecraft to be a primarily building game. On the contrary, I’d say Terraria is an adventuring game. There is no infinite generation, because you are meant to create a world and then explore it, shape it, pillage it, etc. You gradually obtain better equipment, through crafting, looting, or killing, and progress through the game. There isn’t particularly any storyline, much more of a guideline, so you are more than welcome to take things at your own pace, or even just settle down at a certain point in the game’s progression.  The bosses aren’t really sponges of health, and their AI does allow for “skill” level to be relevant. An experienced player can “skip” through progression if they want.  Of course, with a 2D, building may not be as incredibly complex as Minecraft, but there is certainly a lot of potential, and 2D does have some things over 3D.  There is an incredible amount of content, and I spent something around one hundred hours in the latest update. Unfortunately, is it likely there will no longer be any more major updates, but the game already has so much to do, it’s not really that sad. If possible, I would recommend playing with friends, because that helps significantly with smoothing out progression, but single player is good to play as well. Most of my hours were spent playing solo.  Even if you aren’t incredibly hardcore into this game, and just enjoy playing a little bit here and there, it’s not surprising to put in many, many hours. I would recommend this game even at full price. If you’re not so certain, sales take down the price pretty low. Definitely a steal at those lower prices.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"If PETA found out how many innocent animals I killed while playing this,then by golly I'm done for.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Personally i think although the extra content added to terraria over the years has been a good thing. It has come at a cost. No longer do i feel a great satisfaction after obtaining a more powerful weapon or a faster pickaxe like in days of old. My reasoning is this, you always seem to be acquiring new items to your load out which is great dont get me wrong but it allows you to simply leave out large chunks of the game because there are other ways to do it, easier more fun ways.   Back in the day i used to love the jungle, the mobs, loot and genral feel. The jungle armour seemed like such a rare and great thing to have. It took my ages to get it and it was worth the weight. Now they have effectively knocked down item crafting costs to make the progression faster since there was a few patches after hardmode was added where it took absolutely ages for armour and weapons that would be absolite in 5 minutes. Like any game there is a great sense of achievement getting to the next armour and weapon tier. It is a great feeling but not as great. There's a phrase more is better but i cant help but think they went to far in some aspects.   It might just be me feeling this way but i have seen terraria evolve through many patches each brining new excitement and adventure but i think something changed. Maybe it was the charm, difficulty or the look. Im not going to list why i like the game because i could go on all day and make this review 17 pages long. Its just not the same anymore.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"A closed map 2d side-scroller game. seems pretty simple right? At first glance, I didn't understand what I'm supposed to do. the map is small, and there's not much to go to. but I got to play the game and learn about it and it is much more than it seems. with quite a lot of different roles to play and many challenges that you can put to yourself. (including normal mode and expert mode). this game is really worth your time.   If that's not enough, the developers keep developing and updating the game, and you get all of the new contant for just the 10$ you paid in the beginning.   I really like this game. Would recommend to everyone. no matter what your style is, this game is just amazing. both co-op and singleplayer.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Had a lot of fun getting to moonlord and then beating moonlord but after that all you have is building and fish quests. The fish quests are ok if the achievement stopped at 100, 200 is too many ok. I played this game too much.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I absolutely love the game, not much you can go in depth about at this point, theyve just gone out of every other game type and created one of my favorite games of all time, i recommend it 110%",1,0
105600,Terraria,Terraria is an awesome game its a 2-D Minecraft but better with storyline. In Multiplayer theres hundreds of gamemodes you can play in. Terraria has awesome mods and more stuff. I recommend you should buy this game for you and your friends!,1,1
105600,Terraria,"I would recommend this game to the sandbox game lovers. It is a very nice game that will have you playing for hours. Even when you get like all the items which probably would have taken you hours and hours you can always start a new character which was probably more fun than the last because most likely a new update came out which would have added 100-200 items, and probably tons of new features. I never get disapointed from this game. Now for those who think terraria is just a ripoff of minecraft, let me just say its far from a ripoff of minecraft, more techincal, and more action even if it is in 2D, it has a lot of different features, from minecraft which to me makes it not a minecraft ripoff. What is great about this is the lag is kept minimal, so even if you have some laptop thats running windows vista, this has a ok framerate, if you were playing minecraft you would have to get optifine, and all the lag features if you were playing on a laptop. This game can be a bit confusing when you start off, so I would recommend doing some research before you start playing this game, because it will help you a lot a make the game a more fun gameplay experenice because this is very techincal there is over 1000 items in this game. So I would recommend this to any gamer.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I feel I owe this game a new review, as it's been 4 years since the last one, I'm 900+ hours in, and it's continued to grow on me over that time.  Firstly, this game is content done right. They do not pay wall their customers, they release updates and continue to add to the game. This is a practice that should have never died, and the team behind Terraria deserves all the love in the world for continuing to not be greedy and avoiding industry standards.  The gameplay itself, whether you're hunting treasure, fighting enemies and hopin for that item drop, digging out a farm, progressing actually useful armors/weapons, or combining items and finding new stuff, it just lends to itself as a game and this creates depth. Other indie games NEED to take note from this.  The bosses feel right, as well as your movement options whether you grapple around arenas, fly with wings or boots it feels like 2D combat should. The only reason you fail is because of your own inabilities, not intentionally programmed or badly designed mechanics.  The progression feels like you're actually fluidly accomplishing your goals. If you're experienced like I am you tend to not notice how fast you're moving along because you've got the game figured out down to a science. If you're new and still figuring out the game it can feel like its taking forever, but its never not rewarding. When you finally find where to go, or how to beat a boss, or get the drop from them that you want it feels like you went somewhere to get those things. This is something missing from a lot of games that simply GIVE you things nowadays. And even if you run out of things to do in vanilla the modding community is still active and will give you a plethora of new things to do.  This game is worth it even if it was full industry standard price simply because of how much the devs have actually put work into the game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Pros: The epitome of metroidvania-style gaming mixed with a robust crafting system and building that allows for nearly limitless creativity. Mutliplayer can either be great or really lame, depending who you play with.  Cons: There isn't a story or a real focus to drive you forward except loot progression.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"When I was just starting on steam, Terraria was the first game that I wanted to get. It looked fun and I thought it would be a more interesting game than Minecraft.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"First of all, you may ask, what is this game? Well this game is a 2d sandbox game. Though it is much more than simply a sandbox game. It is a challenge, and an adventure. After well over 1000 hours, I think I can review this game.  This game is unbelievably awesome, that I can hardly fit it into words. This game WILL keep you busy. Not only does it have continuous challenges, and BADASS weapons (later on), but this is a game where not just your character gets good. You get good too, and thats something that I can't say about mmo games. Just the feeling of reward when you find a strategy to defeat a boss and you get a cool new item. It is rewarding like NO other game (except killing a triple team in Dark Souls III). To defeat bosses you must find strategies and effective loadouts to defeat them. And eventually you will be able to mentor other players, which feels SO rewarding to know all the tips and tricks and rights and wrongs. The multiplayer is even more fun. Keep in mind, this is a sandbox game (and there is a wiring system), so that means that you can do all sorts of fun things (especially with teleporters), and there is a decent amount of skill aspect to the pvp.  So in short what do I like about this game? -High character customization (vanity) -High skill level and strategy -Very engaging and challenging -TONS of options for loadouts -EXTREMELY cool weapons later on in the game What do I not like about this game? Well, nothing really. There are no downsides to this game. And keep in mind, this is NOT purely a 'kids game' like some nerds on the internet might say. This is an extremely good quality game and I would be willing to pay $40+ for this game. Luckily, its only 10 dollars.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"It is always compared to minecraft it seems, but it is fundmentally better.(Better being subjective) It is a sandbox sort of game with RPG elements. I personally think it is phenomanal and is worth a try at a price that is way too affordable.",1,0

I'd like to put a few rounds in it.' I can't make him say anything else. However that isn't game-breaking and I wholly enjoy this game. I reccomend it to everyone.",1,0

105600,Terraria,One of my favorite games of all time. If you have the money you might as well buy this because it is worth every penny. I have put a countless amount of hours into this game and there are still so many things left to do. There is countless replay ability with this game and playing with friends adds a whole new element. Great for single player or co-op. This is a must have for you games library.  I decided to come back and add more to this review. Since I took a small break from playing this game it has received so many big updates. Going back will be like playing it for the first time again and I'm going to love it. Still completely recommend this game for solo or with a bunch of people.,1,0

It seems as if the game was made to last. I would give it two ratings: Singeplayer: 8.7/10 - Fun, you can do mostly everything yourself. but its tedious and sometimes lonely. Multiplayer: 9.5/10 - With friends this game bumps up immensely. Multiple people multiply the fun factor, especially with 4 peope in one server.

Terraria offers a much different experiance, but includes all the aspects of minecraft you're familiar with. build houses, gather materials through mining and slaying monsters, explore the world, etc. you can easily play with friends through steam and has multiple difficulties for those who want to play casually and for those who want a hardcore experiance. i've logged over 70 hours and still haven't reached end game. I'd highly recommend!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"To be honest, I think this game is better than Minecraft in perspective of combat and adventure. While Minecraft is a great game in terms of unleashing one's creativity, Terraria expands the idea of a sandbox game focused on combat, bosses, and complex events. If you like the cave exploring and boss fighting aspect of Minecraft, I highly suggest to give this game a try.  10/10 would accidentally forget to contain corruption and have to purge it all across my land",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a great game that has many elements of a sandbox game. The mechanics are good and there are multiple difficulties for beginners and veterans.

10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"Single player is awesome. Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥. If you think its going to be an avp2 experience, look away my friends, look away.  Predators are overpowered. Expect games where predators outnumber both aliens AND marines combined. Not as rare as one might think.  You might be thinking 'Oh, i'll be going alien, surely since its a melee only class i must have an advantage in close combat, or at the very least, a teeny tiny advantage.' HAHAHAHAHA! Nice balance.  The entire combat premise of this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing rock-paper-scissors farcical. Light attack beats heavy, block beats light and heavy beat block. As expected, heavy does more damage + has a longer casting animaton. BUT, you can actually CANCEL the animation by blocking! So you can make it look like you're going to heavy attack, and then immediately transition to a block! WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THIS EXIST? What is the ♥♥♥♥ing point of creating a rock-paper-scissors mechanic if you are going to radically change the entire god damn premise of it?  The previous avp games were filled with intense fast paced multiplayer action! And this one is just, disappointing.   If you are going to have a rock-paper-scissors combat, ♥♥♥♥ing do it properly! God!",-1,0
107100,Bastion,"SO much fun. Really unique design - in most places the level creates itself as you walk. Innovative and very visually satisfying. Can only carry two weapons at a time, but it works for the mechanics here, because you can choose which ones are best for the level/enemies you're up against. Soundtrack is great - songs stuck in my head for hours but I don't mind :) The best part of this game though has to be that narrator giving a play by play of everything you do.

Doesn't seem too original to me, I've played many many games that use that same mechanic, to me it's boring to others it might be new.  So what else do we have; the storyline; post-apocalyptic. Trying to rebuild the world. There was a war. Again it's not really original enough for me, fair enough if you've not heard that story before then it might be intriguing, not for me though.  The sound - music is nice I wouldn't class it as critically acclaimed but fits the mood of the game and is varied enough to not bore me. The narration for me is probably the nicest feature, it makes the game a lot more immersive, the voice acting spot on.   Graphic assets; they look OK, they have their own style and feel, environment feels slightly dream-like not sure how that connects with any of the other aspects of the game though.  Can't think of much more to assess, am I missing something? My conclusion is that we have an over-used game mechanic combined with an over-used story but with a half decent soundtrack and a novel way of narrating a computer game. Problem is you can't rate a game on the narrator it's like reviewing a restaurant based on the quality of the plates.",-1,0
107100,Bastion,this game is cute and inventive but the narrator is lamer than all hell and the core gameplay wasnt deep enough to keep me going,-1,0
107100,Bastion,"This game is a masterpiece. It's so simple, yet so charming. The narrator does a fantastic job of filling up the story. My initial verdict on the game is that if you want a fun and charming game, this is a game I cannot recommend more.",1,0

It's a little on the short side, but it could have started to drag if it kept going much longer. The visuals are pretty, the audials are pretty, the story is simple but intriguing, and for only having four characters, it actually makes you care about them all.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"I cannot stretch how marvelous this game is from the design, the aesthetic, and the over head view design down to the detail of the level forming as you move along is just breathtaking. The game being one of Supergiant (I do believe this is there first game and they have ace it in spades, they're also the creators of Transister) games need, NO, should be played by everyone whether casual or not.  Also the soundtrack is INSANELY good, along with Transister. If you are reading this BUY bastion package with the soundtrack you will not go wrong money well spent, the same can be said with Transister with soundtrack.   The hours i spent on this game about 9-13 hours that includes doing the side mission (proving grounds) to max weapons out. Also there is a score attack which includes game plus on to it, if you finish the game in which i did and now on game plus. I definitely recommend this game to anyone best play it on console or pc, AND not on tablet or any smartphone none sense, aslo if on pc on i recommend mouse and keyboard.",1,0

As long as someone has not too much expectations concerning the graphic of this game, one'll be more than satisfied. The control is simple yet not too dull. Further Bastion contains a rather postapocalyptic atmosphere, which is, surprisingly, somehow soothing and gets round off the narrators voice. The longer you play, the more you get to know about the past of the protagonist. That causes the player to identify himself with 'Kid'. Important to mention is the extensive weapon selection.

The story of the game, told through the voice of the narrator unfolds rather nicely, though sometimes it's hard to follow it while being overwhelmed with action.

107100,Bastion,"If you limit your examination of Bastion to its gameplay, you will find nothing special or innovative. A fairly simple upgrade system complements the most simple of game mechanics: click and slash. Bastion is little more than a Diablo clone in that respect.   The true value of this title is found in the game's story and soundtrack. Bastion demonstrates just how far plot and ambiance can take a game. Expertly narrated and backed by a soundtrack that I would have bought alone, Bastion pulls you into the story from the very beginning and maintains that intrigue throughout the entirety of the plot. I enjoyed it immensely.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Yep, I admit it! I played Bastion just for the 'Ride the Wind' achievement to fulfil one of the Great Gift Pile objectives and now am writing this recommendation to fulfil another objective!

107100,Bastion,"Bastion is the Pixar animated feature of videogames.   As for the story, it doesn't come off as divoreced from the gameplay. It plays witht he lore and the story quite nicely and in rare moments changes the flow of the game. With the voice of a narrator you're guided on this adventure which makes the idea that game-like activities are part of the grander scheme of things.  As for the gameplay itself, this is one of the best experiences with intellegent choices in customization and combat since Final Fantasy.   This game tackles decision making in a way that seems almost too freeing. But what the game does with some of the freedoms it gives you is illuminate how the decisions with a sense of permanence really only have an affect on you as a person. But this isn't to say that you're making life decisions while min-maxing your stats. What you'll get in Bastion is a chance to develop a character any way you want and a story and gameplay that reflect the idea that this world is what you make it.",1,0

This is a great little adventure game, similar to an arcade version of Torchlight. The cartoony graphics are perfect, the narration follows your actions and weapons seem well balanced, allowing you to play it as an Alien Swarm type of shooter or as a hack'n'slash adventure. It's fairly linear, only allowing you to chose when to play each mandatory bit, but that's easily forgiven since you want to play it all anyway.

The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group.   Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.",1,0
107410,Arma 3,This game is amazing. Not only can you get just about any mod you want for it- you can get Breaking Point- DayZ in Arma.

This is the best Multiplayer simulator and is definitely an amazing purchase that I've made and I'll never regret.,1,0
107410,Arma 3,"It's a very good game. It's had manny issues with performance, requieres a processor with a really good single core performance, but it's a damn good title.  It recently had a performance update, FPS went from unacceptable low with an i7 4790k and a gtx 970 to more than playable within one single patch. It's a shame the patch wasn't released earlier, as I've had a negative review for almost two years. Finaly the game runs at least somewhat decent.  It's a slower paced shooter, with a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a damn good game. The community is generally friendly, helpful towards newer players and more mature than in other games, but you will still meet idiots and jerks every now and then.  I've played it for almost 1000 hours and I still havn't grown sick of it, ther'es just so much content and mods available.

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. Where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. You will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. The game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like Arma 2 for example. Personally I used to be big on the Battlefield series but once I started playing Arma it was Arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter.   The depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. Everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. Oh and if You don't want to use the vanilla stuff, again there's mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one.   There's also a really fun multiplayer mode called Zues, which is essentially Dungeons and Dragons meets first person modern day shooter. One player acts like the 'DM' and the others play in his / her world. Allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly.   This one gets my whole hearted thumbs up.

It features a unique experience from mil-sim to even a 'life' simulator. it is a community driven and built game that allows community built missions, modes and mods, which makes it the ultimate sandbox for anyone.  My experiences come from a realism unit focusiong on USMC structure and we use mods for comms and weapons/vehicles. My derp around screw around, comes from mass server altis life and wasteland. I'm also taking an introduction into coding and this game has opened me up to a world of creation, of which can be shared by the click of the button to all of Steam.  Also, this game has its issues, its Arma. (slang for, This ♥♥♥♥ is normal). Low scoring or reviewing this game is not logical or well-supported. Play a game or two of Arma 2 and tell me, animations/physics/lighting/mechanics/engine/graphics/rendering/ease of use hasn't improved. The game is a massive upgrade from its predecessors, however lacking a lot of content, and in the end, is an excellent infantry simulator.  I gice the game a 10/10.

Arma 3 Breaking Point has you wondering who to trust, and who to kill over a can of beans. Want to play a  City/Island Life RolePlay  as a Police Officer, Drug Dealer, or various other occupations? Arma 3's gotchu  This only scratches the surface of this games vast communities, but you get the point. The game's players are dedicated and very productive when it comes to making mods, and that's because Bohemia Interactive ALLOWS FULL ACCESS for players to do so, knowing that the players know what they want, and know how to create and tailor it best, while they improve the core game's functionality. This full access has also led to many scripts and 'hax' being made, but their Anti-Cheat has evolved to counter most, if not all, in the recent years. Even if it doesn't catch one, it's incredibly likely that an Admin in your selected community will handle the problem himself.  Having dumped hundreds of hours into both ARMA 2 and ARMA 3, and taking party in many of the mods made by the community, I can confidently say that these are my favorite games and  I would absolutley recommend this game to any friend or fellow gamer.  The games go on sale very often so if you want to save a few moneybucks, you can wait for those, otherwise I encourage any and all to become part of this game and join one of the many communities within it.

107410,Arma 3,"ARMA 3 So when I saw this game for the first time, I thought that soon will release another excellent piece ArmA. However, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. But this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. But I will not criticize. I must say that the guys from Bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. Graphically it's a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. The playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. Technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. Despite this, however, it is compared ARMA I and II, step backward. Personally, I think that would Bohemia Interactive could use a better future. On the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can I say.  Final verdict: ArmA III is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. If it Bohemia Interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better.     8/10",1,0

The freacking mods, i mean in this game if you want a ♥♥♥♥ing private jet riding a horse with a sword there's probably someone who made it and if not you can do it yourself (it's a long ♥♥♥ work but you can).  now bad points:  Physics you make a vehicle explode by driving 3mph towards a rock but you won't explode if you make a 180 landing on a spruce tree from a god damn ac-130 which comes from a mod...

107410,Arma 3,One of the best games out if you ask me. If you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type BF or Call of duty where you just run around shoot ♥♥♥♥ you will enjoy this game. Campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the MP is where the game shines. I personallly play on co-op servers that run Invade and Annex or Patrol Ops and its almost like playing a real war(I highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). You do get the MP servers that run stupid ♥♥♥♥ like Wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or Atlis life(♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. Do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the VIOP to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up.  This game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a REAL war shooter that I have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. This is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! I HIGHLY recommend getting this game.,1,0
107410,Arma 3,"If you are into military scenarios, this game is great for you. With the new engine and actual physics aspects, it takes a big leap forward for the Arma series.

Graphics are better, Inventory system is easier to manage, and how the game runs is better. Frame rate is better and more computer friendly for people that don't have super gaming computers. AI are harder and the campaign is relatively enjoyable. Multiplayer is fun with wasteland and altis life.

107410,Arma 3,"I really like Arma But Since they keep updating and the other game franchies are giving their DLC's for free. pretty much I think that they should eventually give the Apex out for people or at least make the Other DLc's such as Marksman, Karts, Helicopters free because the market on their prices on Apex is more then 20 bucks in my eyes. I think that it would be kinda awesome to see that the DLC's should come out free for owners that have had Arma 3 before there biggest update. If not then I would say that reduce the prices on the Steam Store. Sure the sales are nice, But it only goes down lower to 20 bucks, Which its way expensive for its DLC.

107410,Arma 3,"This is actually a really good,innovative,and realistic game.But I give this a 'No' due to the lack of server with good pings.I live in Indonesia and the nearest available server in my country is China with 200-350 ping.Uninstalled it after I realized I won't be able to play a single multiplayer game from Indonesia. Pros : + Super realistic in almost every single content, main positive side of this game. + Stunning graphics + Fun multiplayer games (never plays it but saw it at YouTube) + Lots of cool mods from the community + You can use vehicles rather than just being an infantry like in other games + You can create your own levels Cons : - Extremely confusing controls. This is the main downside of the game. - The single player campaign is really difficult to beat.I got killed over and over by stepping on mines which are invisible. Yes it is realistic to be invisible but it would also be realistic to have mine detector if you know there's a massive minefield in front of you. With the lack of ability to save, frustration builds up pretty quickly when you always had to start back from the minefield. - It seems the devs ignores the difficulty of the campaign and only allows us to save ONCE every level. It is one of those games where the difficulty outweigh the fun, like Dark Souls and The Impossible Game - Lack of soundtrack makes this game very hard to 'feel'  I don't get any fun from playing this game.Only frustration.My multiplayer's dead and my single player's impossible to beat.If you're from Asia,don't waste your money on this game.",-1,0

107410,Arma 3,"I've logged a few hours on this game so i think i can say a thing or two.   First off Arma 3 isn't your normal First person shooter, This game takes skill, it isn't like Call of duty or Battlefield, ther isn't a rank system and there isn't an XP system. This is 100% millsim, You will throw out into a map that is massive beyhond any map you've ever seen. The combat is random at times and intense with no limit on 'fair gun play' Depending on what mode you play you and with who- you won't be shooting your gun a lot. this game takes a lot of time. The story mode is fun and gets you into some good basic combat along with a fair story line.   MP is full of mods and game modes set for almost everyone looking for either laid back game modes that you can hang out and play with your friends, or 100% tactical millsims that rage on for hours with strict Millitary commands and stratagys.   the editer is another great tool in this game, if you wanna try your skills in editing a mission or just playing down soilder to fight it out you can! The editer puts you in the driver seat for what you want to create!     Now lets talk about what you're gonna need for PC specs; first off forget the reccomended specs it's 100% BS   you're gonna wanna an Intel I5 or I7 first off, this game doesn't like AMD regadlesss of cores.  8GB of ram at the least! 12-16gb is best. And a GPU that can hold up to Armas insane looking graphics ( did i mention this game looks amazing?)    Sadly lagg and FPS drops are all to common in this game, even with my PC specs i get 15 20 frames in towns when small battles are going on.   BI never really optamized this game very well and it's really hurting us players who don't have enough money to dump on a new PC (i've been trying since this game came out toget it to run great, still trying)     so last lets do pros and cons     pros   -millsim tactics  -large multiplayter games  -many things to do from flying,boating,driving   -good story line with easy to get into modes  -realalistic battles with intense firefights    CONS  -poorly optamized   -too many mods on some servers causes issues  -easy to play, not easy to get use to/into     Honestly there isn't much i can say bad about this game. I really enjoy it and have a ton of fun playing it with all the freedom it gives you, if you got a good PC and wanna try something different. Buy Arma 3!",1,0

107410,Arma 3,Arma 3 is very much an improvement on the previous games and I enjoy the smoother combat and animations than Arma 2s clunky movement but the optimization issues and bugs still remain although not as heavy as Arma 2s. It can be a pain to get into games on public servers where everyone just acts like its your typical arcade shooter or the other side where everyone is being a pain by trying to keep it ultra serious and kicking everyone who doesn't say tango down or whatever every two seconds which is why I recommend finding a good group of people like Shack Tactical to play with. But hey you could just ignore it all and play wasteland or arma life servers and never play anything else which is the great thing about gaming. Anyway hopefully this paints an alright picture in your mind about the game good luck and happy hunting!,1,0
107410,Arma 3,Arma 3 in summary is simply brilliant! There are so many game modes and role playing games which lie within this game to keep you wanting to come back to this game! Along with a good community which mods and creates more fantastic games and scenarios to play The game looks great and sounds amazing along with the physics to the most part very good And the Military Simulation is epic and also intense but very fun to plan your strategic tactics to ultimately finish whatever goal you are faced with Arma 3 is great alone or with friends  You can guarantee that the mass amount of time which you will spend on this game is spent well as the pricing of this game is fairly high Arma 3 is addicting and I would recommend this game to anyone! 9.5/10,1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 is probably the closest to a military game I've wanted. It has some futuristic themes without going outrageous, yet has the simulation to make it more challenging. I played and greatly enjoyed the Operation Flashpoint games Dragon Rising and Red River, but felt they had too much of a mainstream Call of Duty-esque to them. Especially Red River. While Arma 3 has a decent storyline, the character development isn't there. The main character has little to grow on and other characters while ok, could use some more backstory. Probably the most interesting is SSG Adams.   Weapon usage, ballistics, and sounds have improved since first released. And it's all welcomed to me. Originally broken up into 3 parts, the latest patch makes it all one long story. I love the first and second parts, 'Survive' and 'Win' respectively. Though they are shorter than 'Adapt.' Win being the shortest with fewer 'cut scenes' than the others. But with the extensive open world, multitude of showcases, and huge multiplayer (which I have not experienced), it has more content than most games come with in an entire DLC season pass. BI has done an awesome job and didn't just give up on it. I highly recommend this came to anyone!",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Summary: Tensions rise as NATO peacekeeping forces begin to leave The Republic of Altis: a strategic fault-line between crumbling European influence and a powerful, resurgent East. But when a key radar facility drops off the grid, a Mediterranean flashpoint risks escalating into global conflict.   Also Gameplay: The engine is a big step up over ArmA 2. Things like the adjustable stances, dynamic fog, physics and underwater terrain add tons of possibilities in the game. Setting: This is one of my major problems with the game. Sci-fi and simulation don't mix well. While I know that everything in the game is possible, the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation. The equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me. Hopefully ACE mod will fix this. SP content: The campaign (so far) is awesome. BI managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism. MP: performance in MP can be horrible, depending on the gametype and server. I don't often find populated servers with interesting gametypes, as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers. Collapse",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"ArmA 3 is the successor to ArmA 2. It is a pretty decent Mil-Sim that seems pretty realistic, but not too overly realistic. I originally purchased the game in Alpha and have had the privilege of watching the develop of the game over the past year. The early game was very raw and buggy with bad AI and questionable engine capability. This progressed in the Beta and it is only after the full release that ArmA 3 is actually getting up to the same level as ArmA 2. Don't get me wrong, I play ArmA 3 way more than ArmA 2, only switching back for the occasional DayZ day. The game has a nice multi-level feel where you can fight with a magnitude of different styles, and, as of Beta, a variety of war machines. The in game mission maker as well as mods such as MCC allow the player to make dynamic and fun mission for single player, co-op, or multiplier. This game is still lacking though as each new campaign update brings more content for players to use. In short, ArmA 3 is a good game, but still needs some work. If you are used to CoD or Battlefield, this may not be the game for you. The online community is very team based and lone wolf tactics may not fly when attacking a town or launching an invasion of the massive Altis map. If I hadn't purchased the game in beta, and I was looking to purchase it now I would advise to buy it either on sale or when most of the content has been added or a larger variety of mods are available. Though the game is in full release, treat it like a beta and report bugs and glitches as there are still a few.   In short: * Medium level Mil-Sim * Heavy on teamwork * Allows for a magnitude of play sets * Allows for creative mission making * HUGE modding and map making community (You will never run out of missions to play) * Promising campaign * Seems like Bohemia listens to their community * AI have some issues * Engine is still not the best * Still missing a lot of content (NATO/ CSAT jets, other NATO forces, guns, etc.) * May not appeal to more casual players (CoD and BF3/4 players)",1,0

Of course it's poorly optimized, has SLI issues (my PIP won't even work with SLI), and is very CPU-intensive, but that's only the beginning of my frustration with this game. Issues from ArmA 2, like the horrid vehicle physics, are still prevalent in this game as far as I can tell from having my APC rolled over by a pickup truck. The fatigue and weapon sway debate aside, this game still clearly has problems and is hardly a finished product *ahem $16 DLC that includes just 2 helicopters*. At this point, I've just given up on BIS, and don't see them fixing this game any time soon. That being said, I have had enjoyable moments with this game, but just not enough to compensate for the amount of technical issues the game has.  tl;dr: Would not recommend to a fan of previous ArmA games, or anyone for that matter.",-1,0

107410,Arma 3,"This joint off the chain. It looks sexy and I find it satisfying to play. If you liked arma 2, this is much more fluid and streamlined. It takes time to figure out all the keys cus theres so many, but its because of that which gives this game a unique experience of control and realism. Now that I think about it moving your head independant of your gun doesn't really do much but it feels baller. On top of all that there's a never ending stream of content on the workshop. Theres even a metal gear solid remake.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"I really got deep into this game and I could tell from the moment I began playing that this was Bohemia's baby. The amount of detail in both the environment and realism was evident and it took me by surprize. Arma 3 is a significant improvement over Arma 2 in every area from the beautiful visuals to the ballistics of the weaponry. I personally am a sucker for realistic shooters so this was right up my alley, the feeling of dropping an enemy from 500 meters with one bullet really gets me excited. I'd recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of Bohemia's past games and likes more of a realistic shooter rather than arcade like shooters similar to cod ghosts and football manager 2014. Get this game pronto as its really good actually just kidding everyone I couldn't run it at all I wish I was dead :(",1,0

Arma 3 gets my heart pounding when me and my friends are playing Battle Royale, Altis Life, etc. This game has amazing physics with crazy bullet drop, actually getting killed when you get shot in the head, unlike some other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough*. Before i got into the PC Master Race I always played xbox, I thought that Battlefield 4 was the most realistic FPS of all time. Then when I got my laptop and my friend got his PC we both got Arma 3 because we had seen gameplay and it looked awesome it was really fun, but since I had a laptop at the time I was running the game on the lowest settings possible and I was still getting 6 fps then i realized if I wanted to play good games I needed a better PC so I built a $900 gaming PC and the game ran great and now it is even more fun since I can actually run it.

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 is the greatest military simulation game that is available. It has its flaws mainly with its engine, but when you look at the game's enormous size, they are tolerable. The developers are constantly updating and patching the game and making it better with every update. You won't find a better soldier simulation nor a bigger sandbox playground anywhere. A very complex editor that requires a lot of patience to master paired with a very active modding community can keep you entertained for countless of hours.",1,0

108500,Vessel,"What Vessel does good is exceptional: tricky puzzles centered around its fluid-based mechanics, great music, and perfect ambience.   Unfortunately, what it does wrong sticks out just as much: Mediocre controls, amateur animations, dozens of bugs, an uninteresting story, and bamboozling AI.

108710,Alan Wake,"Deep psychological thriller at its best. The suspense keeps you on your toes all the time. The writing is brilliant, acting and voice acting are just tasty, dramatic events unfold like in a movie - well, that's what the authors wanted, whole game feels like a movie. TwinPeaks-ish movie. Once you get used to clumsy camera and controls, you're all set to enjoy this intense ride. The visuals are beautiful (I made a ton of screenshots), design is awesome, sounds are engulfing, and the music... both original and licensed, it adds A LOT to the mood. Combat is satisfying, too. A lot of collectibles and achievements, if you're into that stuff. Overall, this is a must-play and unforgettable experience",1,1
108710,Alan Wake,"This game has all the nostalgic horror inspired by people like : Stephen King, Wes Craven, Clive Barker and Edgar Allen Poe.   While the story may not be entirely original, it definitely emerges you into its Twilight Zone ambiance with a twist of x-files.   If the gameplay didn't feel like a console port I would give it higher than 8/10.",1,0
108710,Alan Wake,"This game is just fantastic. If you are into this sort of thing, you have no reason not to get a copy. The story is very well put together with lots of twists and surprises in the plot. Controls take a bit of getting used to with the aiming of the flashlight, but once you get the hang of it, you go on a rollercoaster ride through the depths of the mind of the likes of Stephen King! Graphics are amazing and you will find yourself wondering about looking at everything like a person gone crazy. Value is added by replay for extra items to collect for them achievements as well doing 'The Signal' and 'The Writer' specials that touch up the story. I love this game. A lot of thought has been put into it and everything works together like a well oiled machine should. Enjoy it! I know I did.",1,0

108710,Alan Wake,"I had negative expectations since it was a toybox exclusive only playable on couches, but.... Dammit, it's pretty impressive. The gameplay itself is the weakest link and it's nothing special (average survival horror shooter), but the scatterbrain story, subtle writing, graphics and soundtrack more than make up for it and the TV series style pacing is great. It takes a while to warm up but it has pretty excellent atmosphere and beautiful surroundings. More so if you're already familiar with the likes of Twin Peaks and other influences for this game. I'd recommend it more as a sort of adventure game/interactive story than action-horror, and it is completely linear. So wait, awesome story, setting and style but weak gameplay... This is a Silent Hill game!",1,0
108710,Alan Wake,"It's both repetetive and padded, movement controls are imprecise, driving controls are twitchy, animation ranges from awkward (transitions) to horrible (faces), it is one of the worst offenders of the collectible items in videogame tradition, the constant prompting of what you're supposed to do and where to go is aggrivating, it has the usual console port problems (lo-res textures, badly compressed cg video), etc. etc. The only thing it seems to do absolutely right, completely nails, is being in a forest at night. A forest at night with the presence of what can ony be called 'another'.  But then it does some other things too, which take time to notice and understand, things begin to click, things become surprising. It doesn't actually manage to become a good game, instead it does succeed at being an interesting game. And that's a rare, daring thing to do for a game of this type.",1,0

Although it isn't a GTA shooting rampage, there are many cons to this game and the mechanics it takes advantage of along the lines of its un-rivaled motion capture technology used from everything to npc conversation to intense interrogations.  11/10 Would force my son to play this game.",1,1
110800,L.A. Noire,"So I haven't finished this game on here yet but I accidentally left it on so lmao have some more hours then I've played ANYWAY   I thoroughly enjoyed this game - it basically is a point and click but it's not really. The gameplay consists of going to a crime-scene and interrogating people, where deducing whether they are holding something back (doubt), telling the truth, or lying (when they're lying you always need evidence) - with the facial motion capture its usually pretty obvious. You gather clues by finding stuff at the crime-scene used for interrogations and to figure out the case. You drive to and fro everywhere you need to go. Ocassionally the more you get into the game, there will be chase sequences both in cars and on foot, and there will be shoot-outs, as well as when you have to tail a suspect (without being seen, which is annoying).   The map is huge, and I suggest if you're an achievement hunter you drive everywhere instead of getting your partner to do it.  I enjoyed the story (i guess there kinda was an over reaching one). Each case is pretty interesting, and the game feels very authentic in regards to the period.  A problem I have is the FPS cap, because, come on we are on PC here guys we don't have to put up with 30FPS. There are guides to break the cap which is useful.  Overall the game is pretty good, I enjoyed it anyway :) its quite a long one though so sometimes replayability (especially as soon as youve finished it, can be a bit daunting).",1,0
110800,L.A. Noire,"Thrilling, yet under control. Dark, yet intensely intruiging. L.A. Noire is an exciting experience, for all gamers!  The game is really engaging and interesting because the storyline is rich and well thought out. Ironically, this is L.A. Noire's shortfall as well. The game mechanics seemed pretty cool, but cases after cases, you realize that the mechanics are not very indepth. This makes the game feel repetitive and tedious after a little while.But if you find yourself immersed in the storyline, these little things won't bother you at all.",1,0
110800,L.A. Noire,"[7/10] – L.A. Noire is a very entertaining action detective simulator that has incredible attention to detail and a phenomenal animation system. Yet sadly, its 30fps cap, and dodgy controls at times leave a small void inside me. Even with its flaws, it’s a very fun and mature title, and worth the price of admission. If you like GTA/Mafia II style open world games, but want the intellectualism offered only by more mature titles, then this is for you. It definitely makes you think, and punishes you for poor detective skills, so good problem solving is a must. There are also some pretty awesome action moments with a Hollywood feel to them, and usually don’t disappoint. Overall I thought it was a good ride while it lasted.",1,0

110800,L.A. Noire,"In a city riddled with crime and lies you are one of the few who seek truth and justice. As you climb your way up the promotion ladder in the LAPD you must tactfully determine who is lying and who is telling the truth to solve the case. YOu play as detective Cole Phelps, starting out as a regular cop on patrol you are promoted to detective and other departments of the police force. The graphics on this game are one of a kind, using special effects to map the characters faces to look like actual faces and you may even recognize some faces from well known TV actors. This game is set in the late 40's and it a city where you will shoot down criminals, get involved in mob wars, and you'll never find a woman that wears her hair down...for some reason...like ever...it's wierd...literally every woman you meet will have her hair up in a bun...  This game is one of a kind, a classic brought on by Rockstar games. Usually known for their GTA series where you play the criminal causing chaos in the underground they have changed things up with this game where you play the law, and you will feel the pressure as you hunt down murderers and drug dealers. It is vital that you find the clues and squeeze information out of suspects during interviews or you may not solve the case at all which changes the overall direction of the game.   I definitley recommend getting this game, it is a great story and great gameplay.   Overall I give this game 9 out of 10 Toast for Twenty's.",1,0

I'm sorry the base game should be FTP with the additional content being under $10 (vs $17). There is no demo so you can see if it works for you or if your going to find other players. If it went FTP at least you could grab some buddies and have fun. But given the base game price, it's just too much of a gamble that you'll like it when there are other comparable games for less / free on steam. Shame since this had so much potential, just a bad price model.",-1,1

113020,Monaco,"This is a really good game. It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from. You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think 'oh, this'll be an easy 100%.'  Wrong. There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty. Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.) Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.  But it's a good kind of difficulty. You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you. If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.  8/10  There are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"Run, Fight, Die, Repeat!   In a few words, this would be the game. It's a weird rogue like, quite addictive little game. It's one of the few games where getting an achievement actually helps in-game, the majority of them are unlocking new items, items that you might or might not need in your 'dungeon' exploring. Filled with a variety of items, which give you new powers and new aesthetics as well, every time getting randomized, one gameplay in 100 isn't even nearly the same, despite having the same levels, the maps and items are always random, but you could slowly but surly start figuring out some patterns, despite having a minimalistic tutorial at the start, you will be on your own after room 1. The whole game is a combination of LUCK and SKILL, both of them which are raised by EXPERIENCE (actually playing and replaying the game), it also involves some currency/item management and some though decisions, despite the lack of an actual inventory, you will gamble your way to the top or you will play it safe, the decision is yours.  WARNING: The game uses flash, not just once it happened to me that the game would crash due to high number of powerups/items picked up during the gameplay, resulting to a laggy/crashy gameplay. I played it a while ago, I heard of an upcoming new version, not sure if they updated or fixed the current one.  In rest, nothing bad that I could say about it, except that you will probably die a lot and it has good ambiental music.",1,0

The Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game from the amazing minds of Team Meat/Edmund McMillen (Super Meat Boy, Aether, Time ♥♥♥♥). I'm going to go on a record and say that I can't play the same game without stopping unless i absolutely worship it. This is one of the rare cases where I can play this game FOREVER. It's confusing, makes you think, it's funny, its gross, it's crazy, and downright addicting! Also, it's one of my favorite type of games, being a fan of randomly generated rogue-likes. I would also extremely highly reccomend getting the DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, as it is probably one of the largest and best DLCs I have ever seen. It's like if you grabbed a cake and smashed 10 more onto it and it made a perfect 11-layer cake. That's what this game is when you have the DLC, a perfected 11-layer cake!

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"This game is a bit sick, very dark and greatly entertaining. One of the best aspects is the randomly generated dungeon, so every game is different. The artwork and aesthetic combine monstrous subject matter with cutesy cartoon style to produce something pleasantly disturbing. The nightmares that go through Isaac's head between levels echo the deepest darkest fears of every child; fears that never truly leave us even as adults. I found myself instantly sympathetic to Isaac's cause, and highly satisfied when, through my control, he became more and more powerful and able to destroy the demons that attacked him from every corner of the dungeon.  When he eventually became powerful enough to face and defeat his biggest enemy, I felt like somehow I myself had emerged from the dungeon with Isaac, having overcome not just countless hostile beasts and grotesque giants, but also a darkness in my own soul, and in doing so, became truly a man.",1,0

You play as a kid who has to travel across the dungeons where everything wants you dead, especially your own mother. It feels like a rougelike game with realtime action and you have to use various items you find across the journey to survive. This game will kill you - many many times. However these deaths are not cheap deaths (killed because you have to die) - it's all about your skills. This game is tough to master but when you do it - you will find yourself sucked into the action for hours.  One of the best modern rougelike games. The game has a recognisable style of Edmund McMillen (of Super Meat Boy fame) featuring his twisted visions and dark setting. If you fing this game disgusting or offensive - give yourself a favor and give this game a chance. The gameplay is stellar and deserves everyone's recognition.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"If you aren't turned off by this game's grotesque art style, you'll find a ton of fun gameplay here. The gameplay is an overhead-perspective 4-direction shooter, and you progress through a randomly-generated dungeon. And I mean very random: Everything is random, from the rooms, to what's in the rooms, to the many unique items you can find. No game is the same, and it will probably take you quite a few tries to get to the end; but if you can get there without giving up, you'll probably want to play through again and again to unlock more stuff and experience the different playstyles that naturally emerge from the different characters and the different combinations of items you can collect.  There's also a DLC pack to basically double the already large amount of content, although I recommend trying the base game to make sure you like it before buying that. In fact, you can find a demo of the game online, so go ahead and try that before you buy the base game.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"This game is the worst addiction! It will have you saying one more game after every round. Runs pretty well on laptops with only a few loading hiccups here and there. Wraith of the Lamb pick up is a must; It completely changes the game in many subtle ways. You will be suprised by this game even a hundred hours in. The best part is that there is no pressure when you fail since you can always blame it on the rng. A really laid back learning curve. It is easy to play but difficult to master. The idea of completing the entire scenario in under an hour is very rewarding and great for short play sessions. I love this game but sometimes it does become very unfair and near impossible to complete. Also, while the music is very immersive, there aren't many stand out tracks. There is also a lot of hidden mechanics that are not known unless you read the wiki and items that don't work though I won't tell you which cause I don't want to spoil it. This game is actually pretty glitchy but the glitches are actually a huge factor in the fun since most of them aren't too bad and in fact many can help. There are a few game breaking bugs but fortunately there aren't too many and you always restart into a new game. A quick save would have been appreciated but sadly I had to quit many sessions when I had other matters to attend to. My rating for this game is a 8.74 out of 10 with a high recommendation to buy for casual and hardcore gamers. It is an amazingly deep game and great fun for the kind of people that love learning how the game mechanics work in conjunction with each other.",1,0

The pickups are actually suprisingly diverse and all serve a different purpose, which is unlike most roguelikes. Runs are fairly long, short ones being something like 30 mins and some can take over an hour. One thing interesting about it is you are always unlocking new levels, items, enemies or characters, so not only do the random dungeons add a sense of diversity, but the game is always a little different every playthrough. My biggest complaint of this game is how unstable it is, I have seen it crash and drop out on some very powerful machines, and is almost unplayable on a weaker system with framerates averaging about 15-20. There is also almost always lag when walking into a room, and it doesn't really seem to matter what you are running it on there. That doesn't seem to matter so much, because I have seen this go for under a dollar on sales weeks, and the amount of fun makes it greatly outweigh its own instability.",1,0

Only issue with the game is that it actually becomes a bit easier as you continue to play.

11340,Larva Mortus,"This game is really underrated. It's a cool top down action shooter with some RPG elements. It tells an interesting story that's obviously inspired by classic horror stories à la H. P. Lovecraft. Except for some of the sprites, the graphics are very nice and athmospheric and there are various cool comic-style cutscenes. The only downside to the game is that there are some minor bugs that are fortunately not game breaking. And you have to make sure to configure your graphics-card to not mess up the game's aspect ratio on widescreen monitors. If you can pick it up for cheap it's definitely worth a try.",1,0

113400,APB Reloaded,"Many people consider APB: Reloaded as a P2W game but it really isn't its more skill based you can kill maxed ranked players that own ARMAS Marketplace weapons with the starting gun. The default gun given is the most balanced gun in the game good for long range and close ranged. The Apparent P2W guns are obtainable for rent without paying but require Joker Tickets which you can obtain from fight club. Honestly I feel like this game is not P2W more like you need Skill2Win I would recommend APB to any other gamer out there.   People also forget the positive parts about APB: Reloaded which includes the games detailed character design. The customization in APB is by far one of the best due to the ability to make individual symbols and then place those symbols anywhere on a piece of owned clothing, car or graffiti. Regarding the Symbol editor you have amazing artwork for purchase from other players with in game money that could be tattoos, clothing details, car logos, anime characters, nsfw, guns, and other things.   Positives: - Great customization - Fun - Mailbox at Social District - That nice tingling sensation when you beat a maxed rank gold - Combat is more strategic then a point and click to kill shooter - GM's hold events occasionally and distribute GM Joker Boxes - Fight club for those who like instant action - Variety of guns in which each gun counters another just got to be smart on what you choose  Negatives: - About 1/3 of the cool clothing is armas - The fastest car in game with nitro is as fast as a potatoe (Feels like the max speed is 100kmph) - Occasional server lag - In game 13 yr olds that teabag - occasional hacker   Overall I rate APB: Reloaded 8/10",1,0

Here are some reasons to try out the game -    3 Huge Maps   Ride in teamate's cars   Heaps of Character Customization   Vehicle Upgrades   Realistic Models   Crews - Paint your emblem on your car/clothes   Loads of Weapons   Fast pace shooter action   Dozens of cars to unlock and buy   Shooting out of car windows   You can smash into stores and rob them   Emotes   Good Sound FX   Play your own music in cars   You can be police and arrest people   Good amount of national servers   Alot of co-op missions against other teams   You can sometimes play missions by yourslef with no enemies   You don't need a beast computer to run it",1,0

113400,APB Reloaded,"I'm going to go over my experience with this game during this review. When I first started playing and I was new to the game, I had the most fun I'd had in a long time. Just driving around town mowing down civilians (even though I was a cop) and losing all of my prestige was fun enough. I've always liked the idea of an open world city where players were free to do whatever they want and go into missions whenever you felt like it. The main thing that set this game apart from other shooters was that instead of a list of servers, you get a city and you're free to join a mission whenever you'd like.   The customization in this game is amazing. You can create your own decals to put on clothing and cars. The main issue that I have is the work and time you have to put into the game to unlock good cars, upgrades, guns, and clothing. An easier way to get these things would be to buy them with real money, which I find that many users do to have the advantage over new players. That brings me to my next point.   If you are just getting into the game, you're screwed. Simple as that. You will get your butt handed to you each time you play unless you gather a team of newbs or join more experienced players. After a while you will develop strategies and get better unlocks. If you don't have a high-end computer, you're also screwed.   To finish off this review, the game has potential. Does the game show that often? No. The game needs more updates and the missions get old. The NPCs all act basically the same and after a while, you get bored. The reason that I recommend this game is because I've spent countless hours playing this game and I've had a lot of fun with it for a free-to-play. I say it's worth checking out. I feel like there are better updates to come.  Thanks for reading",1,0
113400,APB Reloaded,"After much more time on this game I can neither recommend or say no to it.   IF you're looking to just kill time and ♥♥♥♥ around with friends this is for you.  If you're looking for a deep competitive f2p shooter with no p2w aspects and a long lifespan this isn't for you.  Presently APB is really not that great. There are many problems with the game and it really will make your experience terrible. First the grinding is ridicolous. It doesn't matter that you can get money as a criminal by raiding for money, or just mugging, it takes a really long time to get cash still and you run the risk of losing it all. If you're an enforcer you really can only make cash by doing missions and that's all. Premium gives you and extra 3rd Premium cash bonus and it helps a bunch. Instead of playing for 5 days to get like 150k you can only play for just 3 if you are getting top of the leaderboard each time.  Gameplay wise, it's fun. Guns all have different feelings to them and the game encourages you to use different tactics to approach situations. Teamwork is also recommended but generally be good at game strats and you can win. Sadly this game is terribly unbalanced. Guns have been getting changed constantly and some of the high end ARMAS weapons which require real money are sometimes better than the default weapons you can get by just playing and the claims about this not being true are mostly from rabid APB fans who have played the game for years and will defend anything the dev does.   Customization is fantastic and is really varied but you can't do much without premium. You get about 3 whole layers of customization for clothing and 6 for cars and that's all. With premium you get like 50 for both and it's honestly a joke. Premium isn't worth just this but the problem is if you get say a week of premium and you make this awesome looking piece of clothing, dont try to change it or fix it after that week because you wont be able to wear that piece of clothing unless you take off all the excess layers sadly. Premium is very badly done and the game has absolutely no incentives to have it other than less money grind and better customization.  Optimization is frankly AWFUL. I use a pretty medium-high end PC and I can get 60+fps on most games but this game is terrible optimization wise. I'm getting 40-50 frames and worse when big fights are happening. I'm fine with 30FPS but when it's a fast shooter like this, it's very unnatural to have framerate that constantly changes. They promised an engine change but that is unknown to when it'll be released.  Community is also legit terrible. It's full of a bunch of APB elitist who defend the game no matter what happens. Say one bad thing and you're attacked by a bunch of children who try to defend this 'perfect game' calling you a moron and to stop crying.  Frankly this game is not worth it if you want to play on and off. You won't get much from the game if you play like that as it requires constant grinding for money to get better gear, and ranking up to Rank 255 frankly is a nightmare unless you play for straight hours on end. Playing this game free is alright. It's not as bad as other games but it takes a lot of time to gain money like I said, and with a community that is toxic, bad balancing, and other issues on hand this game isn't really worth your time if you want to play just for fun.",-1,0

This game isn't for who are looking a good graphics, it is focused on gameplay, interaction and etc... I really don't like RPG games for true. I like games like Gta, but somehow, this game made me be curious and i really decided to download it, and see what would happen. In first minutes, you don't have any clue, any idea of what you have to do and this is the part where a lot of players give up to the game, because almost no one'll help you thought your adventures. You have to have patience, this is the best part of the game. You will be discovering new stuffs, new things to collect, new NPC'S by yourself. The is game is fully of players in almost every part of the map. You have an unexplainable freedom to do whatever you want, and you can do the quest any time you wish. The main thing that made me like this game, is the fact you can have a bike, a car or a horse. there's a good number of vehicles, Atv's and etc.. You can repair your vehicles, paint them, you have to feed your horse, youo have a garage. You can trade your stuf with players or sel them to some specific NPC'S. You'll be playing GTA and dark souls at same time, because this game is very hard.   Why this is a very good game:  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  *** YOU WON'T LOOSE ANY OF YOUR VEHICLES, ITENS OR WEAPONS IF YOU DIE AT ANY PLACE OF THE GAME. *******  - If you die, you won't need to walk hundred of kilometers to pick up you vehicle again. There are some bases near some quest places you can spawn, and you can take your vehicle back easily where you left before be killed.  - Wasn't made for who is looking for a good graphics game. Fallen Earth, is focused on gameplay.  - Unexplainable freedom.  - It's a very hard game, you must have patience and sense of exploration, or you'll give up easily.  - You can play GTA and Dark Sould at same time, choosing if you want to be a casual player, or a high level monster killer.  - You can fight against other players, while defending or invading a base.  - You can craft a lot of stuff, since a simple clothes or even an expensive car.  - You can scavenge stuffs.  - You can do some quests that require a higher level, but of course, you'll die easily.  - Very good interaction.  - You have a lot of skills to improve. Also, you'll earn XP points, and you can spend it upgrading your skills.  There's a lot of things, but you need to play a lot of time to find out. This is just a 1000 square kilometers map!",1,1

They depend on random number generator way too much to be fun to play, you are supposed to not lose too many bubbles before completition, the thing is that so many times you can't complete the B itch because you are always left with unchainable few and they pile up after a while, resulting in an inevitable defeat.

115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"Absolutely fantastic game. Playing on intel/nvidia, have had absolutely zero problems.  As to the gameplay itself, it kind of feels like I'm playing an amoral amalgamation of a bunch of the Marvel superheroes. I've got the claws of Wolverine, the ability to knock people around like Magneto, the ability to shapeshift like Mystique, plus a variety of other things.  Just running around the city is a freaking joy, to be honest. You run straight up buildings, glide through the air, jump crazy distances, pounce on enemies or poor random citizens as you please, etc. It feels like Spiderman without any sort of web-swinging restrictions, or Batman without any sort of grappling restrictions.  To be clear, it's not a superhero game -- but it sure does feel more like one than any game I've played that actually features superheroes. Then again, I'd classify the main character as 'mostly a villain, despite doing things that help the greater good.' My guy isn't concerned with saving random citizens from battles that break out; he actually freaking EATS them to regain health. Or to shapeshift into their form and escape detection.  Basically nobody in this game is a good person at all, and I don't particularly have a problem with that. Even the random citizens seem to be rude at best.  Ultimately this boils down to a power-trip sort of game, with a good amount of challenge despite always making you feel incredibly badass. That's hard to pull off, but this is done super well.

116100,Super Toy Cars,"A racing game with a variety of different competition styles, all set on a miniature scale as the toys of children race around and around. This is the exact premise of Super Toy Cars, as one could easily imagine from the name. Going into the game, I was expecting something either trying to rekindle the days of the Hot Wheels PC games or something to compete with racing games based around cartoon style mayhem such as the Mario Kart series, or even the long forgotten Diddy Kong Racing. What I found was neither here nor there, but something in between.Getting into my first race was simple enough. I opted to do the Career mode to experience the game as well as gain the required points and coins to unlock new races and cars. The race itself lacks the feeling of high speed you would expect from a racing game, but with all the vehicles evenly matched, at the very least there was still that thrill of fighting for first place. Racing around through a course lined with children's toys, shortcuts, and sudden jumps here and there made up for the lack of high speed intensity; then came the power ups, which vary from game changing heat seeking rockets to mostly useless giant 8-balls that the other drivers always manage to avoid with ease due to the slow speed.The tracks themselves are interesting enough, but other than the default races and the elimination modes, there isn't much that grabs your attention to make the game fun. Luckily, the races and elimination modes occur often enough in Career mode to maintain that level of interest.There is the ability to upgrade your vehicles but the upgrades make little to no difference in the overall feel of the vehicles. At most you will get to the front of the pack a little more quickly, but when other vehicles can boost and use power ups the same as you it usually won't matter. Considering the way the AI is established as well, getting to the front of the pack without the upgrades is usually doable anyway, so it's purely a coin sink.Vehicle variety is very nice, however, relating back to looks overtaking the statistical aspects. Of all 16 vehicles, each with several paint schemes, each has a unique flair about it that appeals to someone.Outside of Career, Quick Race, and Multiplayer, there is the Track Editor. Simplistic but fun, it's easy for anyone to jump in and design their dream track within the limits set, of course. Players can adjust the size and shape of the track, fill it with props of their choosing, and, by being able to do those things, they can make a race as exciting and challenging, or as boring and mundane, as possible.Super Toy Cars is not a game aimed towards adults, and yet it was still a rather enjoyable experience even for me. Though it lacked the challenge of big name racers, or the finesse and quirky attitude of games such as Mario Kart, Super Toy Cars still manages to shine where it matters most: fun factor.",1,1

12140,Max Payne,"Amazing. Fast-paced gameplay, a story with effort, and optional slow-motion. Max Payne is one of those games that challenges the 'not art' debate with its comic book style, unforgettable music, and story. There are three problems that hindered my experience, however:  1. I had to download a sound fix (not complicated, but still annoying) 2. Overcomplicated, frustrating dream sequences. 3. Bad autosave system, as far as I know. The game doesn't let you change the quicksave keybind, and sometimes, if you save at the wrong moment, you will die immediately after loading.  None the less, I strongly recommend this game.",1,0

The whole classic Film Noir mixed with a comic book style cut scene system really works well. Highly recommended!",1,0

12320,Sacred Gold,"I had only been playing this game for a few hours when writing this review but I can already tell it is going to suck up many hours of my life. The style of game play is similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight II, the sort of 2D/3D game world style of environment. The main quest chain seems interesting and entertaining, and I've come across a number of side quests, which are easy to obtain, and easy to complete. Not too easy that it is boring, and not too hard that it is difficult and annoying.   If you are a fan of RPGs then this game is definitely worth your time to check out.",1,0

The game offers extra motivation by offering a nice sense of leveling up perks depending the class you choose and each class has some specialities that help you ingame a lot and giving a very nice space for dynamic strategy plans during the game with your friends.

1250,Killing Floor,"Great team based survival game! work together as 1 of 7 perks (classes) including sharpshooter,support specialist, field medic, bezerker, demolisionist, firebug, and comando. each perk is well ballanced (interms of the other perks) and each perk excels at dealing with diffrent situation/enemies and have there own buffs/bonuses. head shots are very satisfing as is leveling up. each perk can go up to a level max of 6 and progress to levels is permenant meaning if in one game you lvl up to sharp shooter lvl 2 you will forever be a level 2 whenever you chose sharpshooter even if its a diffrent server 54 days later each time a perk levels up you gain more benifits to the things associated with that perk, for example a level 2 demo deal more damage with explosives than a lvl 1 demo. and much more than a lvl 1 feild medic. diffrence in levels between players is not a problem because you are exclusively working as a team. so higher leveled team mates are benificail not a hinderance. with atleast 7 diffrent types of enemeis plus a final boss you has a rocket launcher for an arm. the intencity of this team based survival horror game is far above satisfactory. WARNING if you are looking for scary, the scariest thing in this game is the picture of the siren on the menu screen slide show. ... *shudders*",1,0
1250,Killing Floor,"Killing Floor, also to be referred to as Grinding Floor, is a team-based survival not-really-horror arcade shooter. It's primary charm is the insane cluster♥♥♥♥ that is usually the staple of ANY game that involves close-ranged combat, and other players are not your friends; they're on the same side, but damned if you didn't have to fight them as well. The following are a list of well-known player archetypes for this game: Demolition specialists that can't aim for ♥♥♥♥ and will (repeatedly) fire grenades into the back of your head instead of the scrake in front of you, commandos who think they're all that and attempt to fight and aggravate big creatures that is the purview of the sharpshooter instead, sharpshooters who dual wield because they want to do close combat, supports gunning down everything like rambo with their shotguns, medics who solo the entire game because of their body armor, and berserkers being (usually) the most competant player of the bunch. What does this mean? This means that your survival is dependent on people who may or may not knowingly screw you over because the mechanics are not outright defined for new players.  For those who do not know the following, take note: When a berserker is stunlocking a creature with melee, shooting it will cause the creature to break out of stun and maul both you and the berserker who was tanking it. Please do not shoot the creature if you see a berserker stunlocking it. Additionally, if you are a commando and you have been forced into a situation where you had to shoot and taunt the fleshpound to prevent your idiot teammates from dying, congratulations. You've become a Killing Floor veteran.  If you want to play alone, this game is really boring and you should probably get some friends. If you play with other people, this game can be rage-inducing, very fun, or both. You have been warned.  Also, when are they going to release KF2 and add the PPSh in? I thought the makers of Red Orchestra 2 would actually add more Red Orchestra weapons in...",1,0

To help you out, you can have a squad of up to 5 other players with you. There are servers that let you have bigger squads, but you can't build up your perks on them. :( The more people are in the squad, the larger the waves get.  Did I mention the perks system? You have a variety of perks (Medic, Sharpshooter, Commando, Demolitions, Firebug, Support Specialist, Berserker) to choose from, they all start at level 0 but you can level up any of them at any time. You'll probably level up Sharpshooter first since its requirements are the easiest.

Each perk is designed to have specific functions within the game. There are lots of games that claim to be co-op but Killing Floor demands that each player do their job and that overall you work with a team you can trust. Get a team together and have fun!

1250,Killing Floor,"Killing floor the grittier, hardcore and depressing version of Left4Dead. Without zombies (they're not zombies, they're mutants). Oh, and english military. (BLIMEY MATE). This uh...can get old fast, but funny for foreigners to hear. and arenas instead of linear maps...and leveling system...and rounds... In fact, it's not the same at all.  This game isn't for everyone,  you'll get that the second you load the menu,  see the headache inducing graphics and ominous music,  you'll be feeling the game killing you slowly inside. (in a...good way?) It's all intentional, the apocolyptic atmosphere, fighting desperately for your life against odds that get more impossible every round.   It's draining, the maps are dark, run down, abandoned hell holes, and your only companions are your team mates, who will abandon you without a second though (rightly so too, you'll do the same). Oh, I best mention, TEAM MATES. It's a multiplayer only game, ignore the single player, you don't want to go there, find lobbies with people in them that seem like they'll stick around, the more the better.  It brings people together, forces you to rely on allies, you're stuck in hell with them. There are epic times to be had, especially with slow motion cam, and last second kills.  The skills in the game do little, with a grind curve that becomes tedious after a few levels. Only the most hardcore players sinking months of their time are going to get past certain levels, we're talking 10,000 headshots etc to gain small bonuses. They serve badly as motivation to keep playing.  And yet I do play this game still, years from the release, after buying many better games since, I come back and play it for a few hours, not often, but from time to time, every few months, whenever I'm in the right mood.  It fills a satisfying niche in my game library.  I recommend you pick this up, because even though you'll grow tired of it, you'll end up wanting to play it again. How many games can claim to have the longevity of this?  IT'S 5 YEARS OLD AND I STILL PLAY IT.  IT LOOKS LIKE SH*T AND I STILL PLAY IT. IT's ATMOSPHERE KILLS ME INSIDE AND I STILL PLAY IT.

1250,Killing Floor,"How many bodies will you leave on the KILLING FLOOR? This game is best played with Let the Bodies Hit the Floor by Disturbed at max volume like a crappy youtube video. You will also be compelled to spam the 'insult specimens' button just to make sure they know you don't like them. And why should you? They're trying to eat you, afterall.  The game itself can be a bit repetitive, but it lulls you into a neurotic trance of rhythm as you kill waves and waves of zombies. There's ways to change things up and make it slightly less monotonous. My only real complaint with the game is that the perks take a long time to level up, so expect to play for quite a long time until you start the first waves with any weapon beyond a pistol.",1,0

12690,Hunting Unlimited 2010,"This game is amazing. On the surface it may look like a simple, boring game where you spend ages walking around ugly scenery trying to find a specific animal, like a video game in which one searches for a needle in a haystack the size of a planet, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE!!!!  This game is really an epic story of love, betrayal, retribution as well as deer slaughter. The main character is actually a deep well thought out character who's constant silence is reflective of the inner turmoil within his very soul, who's feelings are expressed subtely and beautifully in his every step and every slight shake of his constant companion - his gun. This story is expressed through a series of well thought out missions in which the player has to accomplish goals as part of his quest through the in depth world in which this epic is set.

13520,Far Cry,"I'll review what little bit I managed to play. The intro cutscene seemed to make no sense and it was just a whole lot of random ♥♥♥♥ and then you are taken into a tutorial, and this is where you find out that the controls suck balls.  I won't get too in depth with it but crouching is weird and sometimes it doesn't even do the animation and your screen just jerks down. Sprinting is about 2% faster than your normal speed so all it really does is make you less accurate, does a weird animation and uses up your energy which you need to jump and I think you need it to hold your breath for some reason.  After a little bit of walking you are introduced to the stealth system... Which doesn't work. Press G to throw a rock which is for some strange reason the same button used to throw grenades but that's just a little weird. Now here is why it's broken. There is no delay between an enemy thinking they hear you and them shooting you and this is the best part of the 'stealth' system, I was trying to sneak around and I threw a rock to get some enemies to move and what do they do? Shout 'I've found him!' and they did a 180 and shoot me. So it thinks that it has stealth mechanics but doesn't so your best bet is just shooting everyone but, surprise! sometimes you just die. I don't know how, I thought I had everyone killed but I was being shot so I went and hid and then BAM, dead and remember how sprinting only makes you go 2% faster? yeah have fun running back, oh I'm sorry, taking a leisurely stroll back to where you were to try and kill everyone again.   Animations are just plain lazy, don't look at the machete because you may end up throwing up.   Now, to end this review I will leave you with this. What happens when you decide that it's a terrible game that hardly works? You try to leave, what happens if you try to leave? It crashes and your cursor disappears of screen making it basically impossible to close though I did manage to get my cursor to reappear after locking my account and unlocking it again so there's that.  pros - I can't wait to uninstall it so that's a plus  cons -stealth system is broken -ai is broken -sometimes you just die because the game decided you should die -movement system is broken -game is broken so don't buy it  -1/10",-1,1

13520,Far Cry,"I feel this game is now old enough to be called a classic FPS. Far cry was the secand FPS I ever remember playing and it still pulls me back ever few month's just for some difficult but enjoyable shooter fun. While not aged well it's still enjoyable enough if you can get past older graphic's. This is one of the hardest shooter I have ever played, even on the lowest difficulty it can be almost unfair, especially when I comes to stealth, which I love about this game. If you want a insane challenge try playing the game as stealthy as possible and see if you can get past and few level's without killing. But if you like me you will want to go running and gunning like a mad man to kill all the enemy's and see if you can survive which is a hard but very fun challenge. This game does have some action movie cliches and less then steller voice acting at times, but it's a fantastic game with some very open level's that can be explored more then you would expect from the game like this. While not the best game ever made it stands out to me as a fantasic difficult playable si-fi action movie from the 90's that can make even a hardcore shooter fan angry with difficulty when set high.",1,0

15100,Assassin's Creed,"(I own this on a CD, and that was where I put in most of my play hours) Assassin's Creed has come very far as a franchise. Is the original game still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. If you can get it to work.  POSITIVES: The roots of everything that made the franchise famous are in the first Assassin's Creed. The parkouring and climbing work well, the cities are large and colorful with unique atmospheres, there are plenty of collectibles to while away the hours collecting. The story is pretty good. It doesn't climb the heights attained by Assassin's Creed II / Brotherhood / Revelations, but Altair's journey as an Assassin who has fallen from grace and needs to redeem himself is great, even if it's been told before in other mediums. Graphics are decent (DirectX 10). The game world actually feels larger than some of the other Assassin's Creed games, since you don't fast-travel from one city to another (not at first); you travel on dusty dirt roads through mountains and villages from one city to another. There is a lot of country to explore, and none of the areas feel re-used (though sometimes they can seem extraneous).  NEGATIVES: The game crashes, sticks, and stutters from a variety of issues. My issues were solved by unplugging my internet while playing. The servers that Ubisoft used to authenticate this game are now offline, causing the game to briefly freeze any time I tried to load a save or the game tried to create an auto-save. Lack of an internet connection tells the game to not even bother checking, so gameplay becomes smooth. Even for a game this old, it's hard getting a constant 60fps. If you're running the DirectX 10 version, I recommend setting the Compatibility Mode to Windows Vista SP2.  INDIFFERENT: Activities and ambient conversations recycle constantly. Stealth doesn't have much variety: hide, walk slowly, or mix with monks. Combat is actually boring – once you get the counter ability, countering everything results in a one-hit kill. If you're out exploring the Kingdom, enemy guards are extraordinarily suspicious unless Altair walks at the slowest speed possible. Takes away from the pace of the game. Oh, and don't fall into the water; Altair can't swim, and dies instantly.  VERDICT: A pretty good Assassin's Creed game whose repetitive side-activities don't undermine a decent first attempt at a stealthy open-world-parkour-hack 'n slash hybrid. Hopefully, you can get it to work properly.",1,0

Graphics: The graphics are very detailed, in particular the cities. Also, there are many unique NPC's, which helps to draw you into the intricately detailed areas.  Sound: Consistent to the time period the game is set in, with appropriate music, dialogue and ambient noise.  Re-playability: There are many collectables and lots of optional content, though some of it can be tedious.",1,0

16730,Legendary,"Legendary is that odd little game that stirred up so much disappointment and controversy with FPS fans upon it's intial arrival, but nearly a decade later, is actually much better than a lot of what passes as a FPS game anymore. Granted, this title is still barely Triple-A status, but a far cry from the notorious reputation it garnered. Sadly, this title and the even-more maligned Turning Point: Fall of Liberty both made and broke it's developer Spark Unlimited, which after two failed titles sank into oblivion afterward. This was the far better-looking and far better-playing of the two major-publisher offerings it had, and even though this game's publisher (Gamecock) would also be bought then assimilated into the fold of some larger being, at least for a brief moment it showed that independant developers and publishers could still compete in the Triple-A gaming world. But enough about the back-history, onto the game.  Legendary basically tells the tale of opening Pandora's Box, but in a modern setting. The player assumes the role of Charles Deckard, who is cursed with a life-absorbing sigil on his hand after breaking into the museum holding the box and opening it ubeknownst to it's true power. His employer, one Ormond LeFey, wished to unleash the horrors from the box and then wrestle control of them to rule the world with the help of his Black Order. But the Council of 98 (charged with protecting the box throughout history), jumps to Deckard's aid to try and help set things right. Decent and original enough story, just not executed with the most interesting gameplay.  Legendary isn't awful, it isn't even bad, it just has very conventional Doom/Quake style blast 'em FPS gameplay against mythological baddies like werewolves, minotaurs, dragons, gryphons, Cthulu-style tentacle monsters, and even evil faeries. The garden-variety shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, grenades etc. serve their purpose just fine, but if anything is to be a let down here, it's the Human enemies and their almost listless AI that prove to be the least entertaining of targets in the player's travels. Additionally, this game has areas of infiinte monster respawns, arbitrarily intermixed with areas of finite enemies, so the player never really knows if they should (or can) clear the area, or just muscle through in a bum-rush fashion onto the next objective. Another gripe is the cumbersome fire axe Decard caries around the whole game a la Half-Life 2's Gordon Freeman; that weapon could have easily just been an extra fillable slot for something else.  Graphics were decried as underwhelming, and I agree that on the console ports, the Unreal 3 engine wasn't properly optimized (as with a lot of mid-2000's third-party titles using the then easy-to-license engine), but on PC, turning up everything to it's highest setting makes Legendary more than sufficiently pretty, if not downright gorgeoous at times, and is one of the better titles I've seen NOT made by Epic Games using the engine. Same goes with the aiming: stiff and oddly wonky on consoles, but smooth and perfectly customizable sensitivity even with gamepad on PC. I think most reviewers were playing this on Xbox 360 anyway at the time, so their arguments hold water for that platform. I remember playing this on 360 and it seemed MUCH worse than the PC version that I almost didn't decide to try due to my bad experience with the console version.  Ultimately, this is simple. fantasy-fueled fun that didn't have the right amount of polish or a really hooky multiplayer to reign in enough of the mainstream market, and during a golden era of FPS games where everything was compared to Halo or Call of Duty, that was a massive no-no, in addition to a poorly optimized console port that would end up being the majority of what this game's intended audience played. This should have been more niche, spent a bit more time in the development oven for both the console ports and multiplayer aspects, and maybe Spark Unlimited would be around to this day working on this game's sequels, meaning I would be reviewing the first entry of a franchise instead of a failed attempt to break into the FPS big leagues. For the few bucks this game costs, you could have less fun playing a game on your smartphone, so give it a try.",1,0
16730,Legendary,"Basically the best worst game I have ever played. While I doubt it was done intentionally, Legendary acheives a level of such rediculousness through its story, bad acting, and general concept that it is an absolute masterpiece and a joy to play. It blends science fiction with the legend of Pandoras box, throws in some random mythological creatures (such as werewolves, griffins, minators..,) and it some how 'works.'   The game feels reminiscent of older games like Doom and the outdated graphics work to it's advantage in that light. The controls aren't perfect, and occasionally feel a little 'clunky' (iron sights less accurate than shooting from the hip,) but you quickly adapt by the time you're through the first level.   I picked this up for less than a dollar and I suggest you do too. It's worth a good laugh and to kill some time. Don't go into it expecting the greatest gaming experience of your life though, go in with the same expectations you would watching a b-movie horror/scifi flick, and you'll have a blast reveling in the sheer absurdity of it all.",1,1

17330,Crysis Warhead,"What a derivative, horrible game. Its basically identical to Crysis, with pretty much nothing new. It's several hours more of the same lame story, and mindless shooting at the same enemies, with same weapons, and same vehicles. Again, and again, and again. Cutscenes are often lame or plain silly, with voice out of sync with characters actions. Ending is lame and plain dumb. Just like Crysis, Crysis Warhead is more of a graphical demo, and system benchmark than actual game. Can get it for $5? Go ahead. Just to see the pretty graphics. Otherwise, save your money.",-1,0

17410,Mirror's Edge,"Really good game but too short; it takes about 4-5 hours to finish it. There isn't much to do after you have finished the game.   Pros;  -Excellent parkour -Amazing graphics -Beautiful atmosphere -Good music  Cons;  -Combat feels dull sometimes -Sometimes annoying because you don't have any idea where to go next -Ending was a bit dull  Overall a 9,5 game.  I recommend it!",1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"It's hard to believe Mirror Edge already is six years old but this game has been one of the greatest experiences for me ever since.   Mirror Edge was original because it was the first game to introduce parkour into a first person game. For the most part of the game you're unarmed trying to escape from trigger happy police. You are able to slide kick or punch enemies and you are even able to take their weapons. Guns carry a few bullets so you won't kill that many opponents but that's alright since it's not what this game is about.   Most of my favourite games have a great story but Mirror Edge is an exception. It's not like the story is bad but it's not great either. What makes Mirror Edge one of my favourites is simple: Atmosphere. It's just amazing to run around sky high buildings, escaping from the police. The buildings all look white and clean even the indoor industrial areas look clean which are just great to look at. Even falling down from tall buildings was something I enjoyed and made dying a lot easier.... in a way.  The graphics are still great for a 2009 + Mirror Edge has a great OST.   This game is not recommended to people who want to kill lots of enemies but everyone else who is open to new things should really try this game at least once in your life.",1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"Very short, (I beat the storyline in 5 hours) but very fun. Picked it up for $5 on sale and it was absolutely worth it.  The movement is amazing. With about half a dozen techniques to use, you can approach most of the game from a variety of (literal) angles. There's also a time trial mode to really test yourself.  What little combat there is is intentionally clunky as you're a 'runner' not a 'fighter.' But if you master the movement, you can do some amazing combat techniques too. I, however, settled on repeatedly doing a running slide and kicking every single opponent in the junk over and over. Crude, yet effective.  The platforming never felt 'cheap' like in a lot of platformers, where you need nearly pixel-perfect precision. In this game, if you're having trouble with a jump it's more than likely you're using the wrong techniques.  There's not much to the story, so don't expect anything wonderful there. Someone wronged you, you're trying to figure out who they are and why they did it. Nothing epic or grandiose like saving the world, it's pretty much just personal revenge with a bit of a political background.  I had a few minor issues, including one slowdown/crash that was remedied by simply turning off PhysX in the options. Other issues were my character not grabbing ledges that I clearly thought she should, or at one point I must have 'stubbed my toe' mid wall-run because I just stopped and fell off the wall.  Due to the extremely short length of the game, I can only recommend picking it up on sale. It has difficulty settings, time trials, and some collectible items, so there's a small bit of replay value to it.",1,0

17410,Mirror's Edge,"Fair warning: This game didn't necessarily age as gracefully as other games this age. The fast-paced nature that got the game attention is exactly what makes the game feel a little clunky today. Even with that in mind, however, I still think the game is absolutely worth playing today. The first-person parkour platforming is still a genre that hasn't caught on as much as I wish it would, so it's still relatively unique amidst numerous generic FPS and RPG games. If nothing else, it will make you appreciate the sequel tremendously when it comes out later this year.",1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,This is a nice game.,1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"Mirror's Edge is essentially a trial-and-error game for me. The Reaction Time feature works wonders! However, although the game features moves heavily inspired by parkour, I felt that the only overwhelming stunts were the box vaults and the wallrunning. As a first-person point-of-view game, seeing the vaults being performed were much less appealing. The main character could have been more relatable if it weren't for the fragmented revelations of her past. I know that this is not that kind of story, but the motivations for each character, although explicitly stated, passes by too quickly without giving the player a chance to be immersed in the game. The game also promised melee combat yet most of the enemy NPCs wield guns and are VERY TRIGGER HAPPY. I see no reason to shoot an unarmed assailant even at point-blank. However, if the game is made such that the player should avoid most conlicts at all costs by just freerunning, then the selling point of this game is half-achieved. The game is actually short minus the parkour fails! I expect more from the next installment! PS. The sound effects as she falls are gut-wrenching. As an acrophobic, I approve.",-1,0

18820,Zero Gear,"Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.  The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.  Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.  Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.  If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.  In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.  As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.  There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..  Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.  While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.  There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.  Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.",-1,1

19900,Far Cry 2,"Give me FarCry 2 any day. Destroyable gas stations, respawning checkpoints (I have no idea why people hated these with so much passion. Park the truck, pull out a launcher and blow the ♥♥♥♥ up!!), diamond discoveries, different landscapes with unique terrain. FarCry 3 is like the hot supermodel that doesn't have all the intelligence that a normal girlfriend does: She's great to look at but the depth of conversation and the ability to draw you in are severely lacking. I have an extremely difficult time believing that the main character matured from no combat experience to wiping out an entire cartel.  This was my review for FC3 but I feel it also belongs here. I won't play FC4 and probably won't touch Primal either. FC and FC2 were by far and away the best of the series. What other games allow you to burn dry grasslands to draw out your enemies like the cocaine runners did in Crocodile Dundee 2? None. The AI is spot on in all their responses and for a game this old, they take cover really well. Landscape was incredibly well detailed to the point you would think it's a Bethesda title and this game made you WORK for victory. Shame on all you crybabies that ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about Malaria or jamming guns or respawning guardposts. Y'all missed the damn point of the revolutionary gameplay that made you HUNT your enemy. I felt like a lethal predator sneaking around with my silenced handgun, silenced shotty (Anton Sigur, anyone?), and a flamethrower.  I also learned that the only tool you'll need in life to fix engine, radiator and body damage is a ratchet.",1,1
19900,Far Cry 2,The best of all of the far cry games in the series.,1,1
19900,Far Cry 2,"Of all the Far Cry games THIS ONE is my favourite. Many people despise this game - truly a 'love it or loath it'.  Your poorly maintained weapon will jam, missfire and break. Mercs will block your path at checkpoints and ruthlessly hunt you when you try to get away. Bush fires will turn on you and have you trying jumping in rivers. You will be overcome by MALARIA when you run out of medication.   And those are the positives.  Pretty average AI, ememies are bullet sponges, some washed out colours/textures, lack of predatory animals. + originally there were a couple of 'point of no return' situations that meant you would miss out if you hadn't already played through the game and knew what to do before a certain time.  Have played through it a few times on console (hundreds of hours), now going to try new content and modding to see how the game can be improved on.  Africandave simulator 2008",1,0

19900,Far Cry 2,"Having played the profoundly satisfying Far Cry 3 less than a month before this, I can't tolerate this game's shortcomings.  I find myself mashing 5 to get my bearings, staring at the map rather than the lush surroundings. Firefights are painfully basic and the sprawling map makes me feel horribly lost. The narrative is hampered by some of the flattest, least immersive voice acting I've ever heard.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ggpdU4gFs   NPCs bounce around erratically, the game's default settings are bare minimum, you spend the game fighing a debilitating disease, and the seemingly endless number of enemies spawn from any direction and can wipe you out befor you can get your bearings and figure out where the hell they are. Everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and out to get you and every time I've died I had no idea why or what killed me.   Avoid this dated piece of crap and start at Far Cry 3.",-1,0

19900,Far Cry 2,"This is the followup to Farcry? I realize this is the first in the current crop of Farcry games, but Crysis is the proper followup to the first Farcry. This game only resembles the first because it is an FPS and it is in a tropical setting. This game is more an open world FPS. There is a ton of empty crap to do and it more or less all plays out the same, with the worst part being the respawning enemies. It has interesting systems, but it's basic Ubisoft fodder. I have read about how all Ubisoft games seem to follow a similar setup just in different settings and camera perspectives. So between the bit of Assassin's Creed I have played and after playing this, I can see some logic to that observation. The premise for the game is good, things aren't as they seem (of course) and it's there just enough to keep you going, with that said, NONE of the characters are likeable.  I personally cannot recommend this game, but I don't think it's bad for someone who wants to go around shooting people/things and exploring terrain.",-1,0

200010,Quantum Conundrum,"A first-person puzzle game in the same vein as Portal, but voiced by John de Lancie! (That's the actor who played Q on ST:TNG, if you're a fan of the show.) The game suits him well, charming with a unique brand of wit and humour sprinkled throughout each puzzle. It's a delight to play and, while many of the solutions are somewhat rigid, more than a few allow the player enough freedom to come up with their own answers to each obstacle.  Unfortunately, since Mr. de Lancie's commentary, as the professor, greatly establishes the mood and tempo of the game, I cannot recommend the DLC. Ike-Aramba! and The Desmond Debacle fall flat due to their monotony and most of the puzzles in them are less puzzles and more sequences of specific timing where the slightest error--in a belligerently linear solution--will have you pulling out your hair as you try and try again. At least the checkpoints are frequent enough that you never have to start a puzzle from the very beginning.   The short version : Buy the game--it's really fun, and spring for the DLC if it's on sale. It's six extra multi-stage 'puzzles' each, but the real fun is in the core game.",1,0

200170,Worms Revolution,"The multiplayer in this game is some of the best out there. Customizable game modes, a map creator, and lots of items.  However, this game isn't perfect. For one thing, the platforming is terrible. If you fall and take damage, costing you your turn, half the time the controls are to blame.  Then there's the single player campaign. The AI is the very definition of perfection, and is some of the most unfair AI I've ever seen, and I've played a lot of Mario Kart in my time. You could be on a tiny floating chunk of land just big enough to stand on and an AI worm can throw a grenade from across the map, ricochet it off walls and celings and get it to land perfectly on that worm's head without bouncing off. Not only are they unfair, but as you progress, they start to outnumber you more and more. I've gotten to the point where I've started with only 4 worms and the AI has 10. Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys games like Dark Souls, where the challenge is based on how unfair the AI is, I wouldn't touch the singleplayer with a 10 foot pole.

10,Counter-Strike,"The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. That's when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CS:Source. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Vir's Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CS:S. There's a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me (over 1400 hours, at last check); it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CS:S tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. It's always good to have the classic. And seriously—I only play CS and CS:S in the series; CS:GO's pay-to-win system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. It's that simple. No, I'm not good enough to do pro gaming. I'm not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friends… all without paying for deus ex machina.   I don't play WoW for similar reasons: I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free (libre) servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Pay-to-win is arguably worse than pay-to-play; it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, that's why I love CS and CS:S. It's just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. There's no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.",1,0

10220,Postal 3,"Unfortunately for RWS, this game was really badly developed and completely unoptimized. It's not their fault as they handed the development off to a russian company that started having financial troubles and had to lay off their prime team because they couldn't afford to pay them anymore. Instead, they fell back to the backup team which couldn't handle most of the intended design, and the game had to be extensively redesigned to accomodate their lack of experience and skill. I believe the company has completely shut down now, and won't give RWS the source code so they could properly clean it up and perfect it. Instead, RWS has chosen to abandon this horrible game, and resume working on Postal 2. Buy that instead, don't waste your money on this game!

102600,Orcs Must Die!,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  A few things that it does it does, decently.  This game, and its successor, in my opinion, were attempting to ride the coat-tails of the highly anticipated, and much more highly refined, Dungdeon Defenders. It is a poorly coded, excessively bland, tacky, generic FPS tower defense crossover. The DLC may as well be called 'EZ-mode'.  the voice acting will grind on your nerves, the enemies are so stupid.... its indescribable. They said they would come out with some multiplayer component (i.e. WTF THE GAME YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO COPY HAS THIS AS ITS 3rd SELLING POINT, WHY DID YOU NOT INTEGRATE IT?) that would be DLC, but saw that there was enough demand for it that they would just crank out a sequel. That is the kind of developers you are supporting by buying this game. Yes Dungeon defenders has an excess of DLC, however they are still supporting it, this game has been left in the dust less than a year after it was released. The developers should feel shame.",-1,0

102840,Shank 2,"If you liked the first Shank game, be wary of this sequal. While the core of the game is the same, what they added is not enough to make up for the subtractions.  The controls seem to be a little nicer with the ability to stop combos and such, but the ramped up difficulty on 'Normal' can cancel out that ability as it seems there is always a new wave of enemies (always including a ranged mob) that will knock you out of the combo.   Boss fights, as well boss fights. We all know the jump, dodge, attack and repeat nature but this time they liked to add in atleast 2 more random baddies to the equation. It's bad enough I need to jump, duck, dodge and roll and then attack the boss but adding more random crap in to the experiance doesn't make it 'hard', it makes it tedious.  If your looking for the sidescroller, try the original Shank or Mark of the Ninja, both a much more enjoyable experiance.",-1,0

105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,One of the best adventures I have ever played! Wish there'd be more games like this.,1,0
105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,"Summary:   An average point-and-click adventure game with a stupid story, a poorly written ending and a badly conveyed environmental message. But decent puzzle design. Buy it cheap, try to ignore the story and you’ll have a decent time with it.     Full review:   You play as Bent Svensson, a retired and miserable algae researcher, and Fay, a time-travelling radio operator sent from the future to save humanity from global warming. She will do so by getting people to use Svensson’s algae to produce energy instead of fossil fuels and atomic power. As characters they are… okay. You can have a lot of comments about Fay, but at least she is not Goal from Deponia, who spends the entire game unconscious and is nothing but the “Goal” for the male protagonist. Fay’s not particularly funny, but she’s okay to play as. Same with Bent, not the most uplifting character, but decently portrayed. This can be contrasted with some of the side-characters that are just god-awful. Especially Duve, Bent’s son, who I would say is probably one of the worst designed characters I’ve even seen. The voice-acting also ranges from decent to pretty bad, though I often got the feeling it was not the voice-actors fault but rather how they recorded and handled the audio files.  The story is pretty stupid. Time-travel tends to bring that out in a story, but unfortunately it is not limited to just the time-travel. I appreciate the message they are trying to convey, I really do. Unfortunately it is told in such a heavy-handed manner and in such simplistic terms that it loses all meaning and is very unlikely to convince anyone. After a while they try to go a little deeper into the issues, but it is too little too late. Other than that, the story is functional if uninteresting throughout most of the game… until the finale, which just utterly sucks. For the sake of a “twist” they completely disregard everything that has happened previously and what little rationale they had for their characters suddenly vanish. I mean, if the ending is true, why is Bent even in the game at all? Incredibly poorly written.   The puzzles then. They are the standard Deadalic mix of item-based puzzles with some minigames thrown in to add variety. Overall I found the puzzle design pretty good and really the only reason to play the game. Just like other games of the genre there were some instances of puzzles not making that much sense, but these instances were comparatively few. On the other hand, there are also no real head-scratchers or anything particularly inventive about the puzzles either. Pretty bog-standard.   So, why am I even recommending this game? Because the puzzles are pretty nice. And even though the story is not very good, it was not until the very end that it’s really awful. It’s an average title that you should buy cheap and play for the puzzles. Or get a really good adventure game instead.",1,0
105100,Lume,"English:  It is a game for 5 minutes. But one or two of the puzzles are absolutly NOT doable! Really. In every Walkthrough I had to watch, they also said that those puzzles are not possible! And after ( about 5 puzzles ) the game ( well. 'part 1' ) is over.  Really disappointing! I really wouldn't buy it for 7€! Thank God I paid only 2€.. that is too much either .. sadly!   Deutsch:  Ein Spiel das nach gefühlten 5 Minuten zu ende ist! Dennch sin ein bis zwei Rätsel absolut nicht zu lösen! Also wirklich nicht zu lösen!

105600,Terraria,"Let's start by saying.. 118.1 hrs have been added to my play count since 1.3 came out.  I have played no other game since.  It's time I start reviewing this game.  Definitely, without a doubt, my top favorite of all games, Terraria offers stunning amount of gameplay material for a stunning low price. Though some parts of the game you'll spend grinding, you just can't complain with the ~50 hours you might just spend on 'completing the game', aside from grinding. Huge time consumer, and though I admit not everyone would like it, I feel like the majority of people who don't have this, think this is going to be another minecraft copy. I love both games, but Minecraft just can't compare to this. The content is much, much more. Terraria is more focused on battles, while Minecraft is more focused on building. So perhaps this game is recommended for the fighters, and Minecraft for the builders.. Well, I wouldn't even say so. Terraria offers a large variety of furniture to fill your houses with, loads of blocks, which you can paint (every single one of them) and during that... Finding the resources is a lot more fun as well.  For 9.99, this game is probably the cheapest game if you compare it to the amounts of fun you will have with it. It is worth every penny (which I did not pay, more on that later). Search my name on steamdb, sort by price per hour, look at the best deal.. Yes. For 2 cents per hour, this is the cheapest amount of fun I'll ever have. And the best fun I ever had. Can guarantee, if I had to choose between 1 hour of Terraria or 6 hours of Portal 2 (by that let me also tell you that Portal 2 is my second favorite game) I would have to choose Terraria. Got this game gifted from a friend, I love it, and won't be done for a looong time. Wish I could give that friend a big hug. If you get this gifted, don't wait for a minute. Play it, enjoy it, give your friend a hug, because they just gave you the best gift you could possibly get.  Thinking about getting it yourself? If you have at least 3 friends, I would even recommend the 4-pack. Especially when it's in sale. You'll have tons of more fun with friends, and your friends WILL enjoy it.",1,0
105600,Terraria,This game was the first game I brought on steam. Having played the game on Xbox 360 Edition I know i was going to expect better things from PC version.  This game in my opinion is amazing. If there's a game that you want that you can enjoy it is this game. Seriously 10/10,1,0

105600,Terraria,"Honestly, this game has been with me through thick and thin, through all my family and school troubles, it's been there slowly updating, giving me new things to do, more awesome items to enjoy, more events, more everything. I realize not everyone can or will have the same experience i did but thats ok, because this game is given a special spot in the minds of those who play it, and enjoy it. Now for some people this type of game just isn't your cup of tea, and i understand that people have different tastes, but if you bought this game because it was cheep and had good reviews started playing it and thought it was boring, or you could'nt get into it, then i have to tell you this games major flaw, it's beginning, there are plenty of folk on my friends list who have 20 minutes in this game because of exactly that, they thought the whole game would be like the start, and it's not the best most meaty part of the game is the middle, where you have the most fun and spend the most time, theres a lot of reasons for this and you really ought to see them for yourself.  So if you are one of those people who bought the game and quit early, or even if your thinking about buying i'd say two things: number one, Buy it, it's worth whatever it's on sale for and more, and number two, give it a second chance power through the start of the game and really see where it shines. Overall i give this game a perfect 10/10 would recommend.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Some say this is the counter game to Minecraft. Well I'm here to tell you, it may have the same sort of gameplay however, what people do not realise is that Terraria offers a lot more content then Minecraft does. This game is a success in everyway from been able to track your current whereabouts on the map with ease all the way to beating powerful Monsters and Bosses and gaining stronger equipment. Your task here is to simply survive as how you would in any survival outcast game with the acception of 3 tools already made avaiblie to you at the beggining of your journey to help start you off. For those who recently heard about the 1.3 update, it actually added in more content to the game that made it more enjoyable however, ever since the update, people have been getting recent glitches and bugs so there are still a few kinks the developers need to fix up. I will say though, I have only stumbled upon a glitch only on rare occasions so it shouldn't be a problem. My PC is intel core processor with 4GB Ram and the game runs on Max settings almost perfectly however, it's best to turn off backgrounds scenary for best performance. PC's with intel Core i3 or up might not have that issue. For new players, I can most certainly recommend this game!

105600,Terraria,"Ok after 100 hours of playing I should now make my review to Terraria.  First, it's a great and fun game! It doesn't get boring that fast like other games with cubes (Minecraft...)  The bosses are really fair and balanced, its fun to fight them and everything is well made.   If you still don't know if you want to buy this game, here are the reasons why you really should!:  Pro's: + Super Fun Gameplay + Nice bosses + NPC's (&lt;3 Stylist &amp; Party Girl) + Quests (Only fishing up to now) + Multiplayer with free hostable servers + An expert mode for player who want a challenge &gt;:D + Hardmode (after defeating the 'World of Flesh') with more ore's, a new hard biome and more challenging bosses. + Many ways to playtrough + More stuff coming + Events! (Halloween, Christmas, Eastern and more!)  Contras: - Lags (not often, but they exist, specially in multiplayer)  I hope I could convince someone to buy this great game! Thanks to the developers!",1,0

105600,Terraria,There are so many things that you can build. My favorite game atm.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a fun and charming game that will entertain you for hours. It has +1000 items, a lot of bosses to fight, multiple biomes, mounts, NPCs... and they keep updating the game adding more and more of these things. It's really hard to get bored if you enjoy playing it.  Keep in mind that in this game you'll have to gather resources in order to progress. Some people are not interested in those kind of features where you are forced to spend some time doing the same thing over and over like going out to chop down some trees in order to get wood, it's totally understandable. Don't misunderstand me, you are not 24/7 gathering resources, but if you like to build or decorate, or you are looking for a rare drop of an enemy, you'll have to work. In Terraria you'll progress by gathering resources, defending yourself from the vast variety of enemies that roams the lands around you, killing bosses and exploring.  While exploring, you'll find chests with some precious items inside and NPCs that will help you out on your adventure. Those NPCs can live inside your house if you build them a room although some of them need some more requirements, it's a good idea to take a look at the Terraria Wiki to know every detail about the NPCs, some of them will only appear after meeting some requirements like for example killing a boss. Those NPCs will help you out selling precious and powerful items that will help you on your adventure, healing you or giving you some quests.  One of the things I like the most is the huge customization of the world and your character. You can build your house however you want, wherever you want. If you build a massive house, don't worry because it won't feel empty. One of the things that I dislike from other sandbox games is the scarce decoration of your home, in Terraria you can make everything you want. Sometimes you'll have to make it even bigger to put inside even more things because you run out of space!  The multiplayer aspect has improved a lot since you can play with your friends via Steam, it's as easy as joining they world, you don't have to use third party programs to be able to play together. :^)  To sum up, Terraria is a great game that will satisfy collectors and explorers, with its massive quantity of items, enemies and places to explore. I mean if you've read everything and you liked it all, for 9,99 it's an amazing price. It won't disappoint you and if it does, you can always refund it. ^_^   I hope my review's been useful and have fun!",1,0

105600,Terraria,Perfect Game.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"What an...odd game. What first comes off as a simple 'Minecraft 2D Clone,' quickly becomes it's own identity and a completly different experience. When I first began Minecraft, the open-world and complete lack of direction was a big driving point. The same thing happened in this game. Both games have you dropped down into a world where you must gather supplies by mining, chopping trees, and killing enemies. Both have you build houses, upgrade your weaponry and armor, and survive the night  But that's where it ends...  See, Minecraft is an open book, You can only fit armor on and the occasional pumpkin. In Terraria, You can put on rings, hats, masks, climbing claws, quick boots, double-jump boots, climbing boots. It's very interesting to find a chest because the utter unknowing in the players mind comes into play.   Then the bosses show up. You feel the progression in this game much better in Terraria because there are multiple bosses. You walk into the Wall of Flesh as a Newcomer in this game and you'll get your ♥♥♥♥ handed to you. But you finally beat that boss and you see how far you have come. You get the same feeling in Minecraft but less often. There are multiple bosses, each unique in some way. Minecraft has a dragon and The Wither...while Terraria has the Eye of Cthulhu, Wall of Flesh, and many more.  The ememies are much more likable and unique here too. The slimes that roam with sometimes have an umbrella or a zombie will be wearing a space suit. Either way, they have more personality than the generic zombie, skeleton, spider, etc. of Minecraft. Not to say Terraria doesn't have these enemies but the small touches bring out a character in them.   The graphics are another praise of mine. Everything has so much detail. I, for one, am not a sucker for 8-bit,16-bit games just for the sake of novelty. I love Minecraft but it's hard to look at after a while sometimes without a texture pack. So much color and detail leave me staring at the wonder of every pixel and item found in the world. Unlike Minecraft, the pixel presentation ENHANCES the experience. This wouldn't be quite as beautiful if it wasn't colorful and pixels made up the world.  And the most important point is the Gameplay: This game feels very differant than any game I've ever played. It is unnatural at first, especially the building mechanics. Things can quickly become a mess if you aren't organize and stay on your feet. If you designate a button for sword, pick, axe, hammer, torches, potions, etc...you'll stay sharp. Everything feels tight, however, and you know that every mistake is on you...Although getting knocked to your death by a flying fish can be heart breaking, you know that you had every way to get around it. The game is pretty glitch free and I have only encountered a small glitch with playing multiplayer. It's a smooth, tight, responsive experience.  Overall: 9/10. Terraria blew me away. It's tough sometimes to go back to Minecraft a lot now that I've started. I used to feel Terraria was overrated and not worth my money, however with expanding from existing mediums, this game creates a better world than I could've imagined. I recommend this game in Multiplayer because the utter difficulty at first can destroy you. Also...it's just more full to send you friend or brother into a massive pit or lock him out as the deadly eyeballs crash into out house in a tree.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Great game, Love the many choices of weapons, armor Etc. 10/10",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is one of the greatest games this decade. Hands down.   Rarely does any game allow you to create as well as it challenges you. There's always something to do, see, create, fix, build, fight or experience. It's truly a transcendent product that spans all interests and genres. There's not much I can say which hasn't already been said. This isn't just Minecraft. It is a very distinct product and everything from how you gather resources to the boss fights to the building is different.  It's not hard to learn. In fact, 10 minutes on YouTube will teach you most everything you need to survive. But there's always the next step, next goal and that's going to take some effort. But if you put forth the effort it will be rewarded.   There are countless reviews that talk about the gameplay, so I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to talk about what appeals to me. The graphics are adorable and the music great. I spent probably 5-10 hours just crafting my own little village and another dozen creating a fort to protect myself against invasions by goblins, monsters and other creatures. I built a massive water tower, a tunnel all the way to the bottom of the world and I flooded hell. I built an underwater glass tunnel through a massive hole that I cleared from corruption. I created a cloud world. I created my own personal pyramid. I created my own stadium to have boss fights in.  It's that combination of creativity and challenge that is so very rare in gaming and Terraria has it in spades. The highest recommendation I can make is simply this: there are exceptionally few games that belong in everyone's collection. They're so rare they can probably be counted on two hands. Games that offer something to everyone and do so well are incredibly rare. Pac Man. Mario. RollerCoaster Tycoon. Games that can appeal to people from 5 years old, hardcore gamers and your grandmother. Terraria belongs on that list and it belongs on yours.  Moreover, years later there are still patches and content enhancements. You simply can't lose buying this one folks.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is simultaneously simple and complex. I initially just enjoyed the game casually and completed the unstated objectives, but I continually felt myself drawn back to play some more. In my additional times playing through I have enjoyed PvP with friends, deeper digging/grinding/exploration for equipment, and more creative construction of my home/base area. If you haven't played Terraria yet, I highly recommend it. The cost is generally pretty low and it has had some awesome Steam sale prices!",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I could write a review of this game, but so many other people have written exactly what i would say. so, i’ll just leave a recipe for a breakfast omelette:  you will need: 3 eggs a tablespoon of milk 4 bacon strips cheese 1 potato ¼ red onion salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayanne pepper(a dash of each) cooking oil  Start off by dicing your potato and onion into little bits, then dropping that into a medium skillet with some oil. cook over a med-high flame, stirring frequently so that the potatos don’t burn. salt lightly. takes about 15 minutes to cook. when done, the outside should be alittle crunchy, the inside moist. onions will blacken, thats fine. remove from heat and set aside to dry in some paper towels or coffee filters.  Next, start the bacon, just plop that in a skillet and cook it for 3 minutes, flip, cook for 2 more minutes then add to your potatos. While the potatoes are cooking, you can start to prepare your eggs. just crack all 3 into a cup, add the milk and seasonings you want. mix it up so its a uniform yellow. get a medium skillet warmed up.  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! the fire MUST NOT be too high or YOU WILL BURN THE OMELETTE! it needs to be a low flame. heat up the skillet, grease it with cooking SPRAY or butter, then drop in the egg mixture. if you didn’t stir it enough you will see an egg yolk in your pan. If you do, just make scrambled eggs.  If you did it right, the eggs should cook slowly. As they start to become solid on the bottom of the pan(but still runny enough to move around the pan, it will be 2 layers), add a layer of cheese over HALF of the omelette(not too much, you will add more later and the grease from the cheese will RUIN the flip). add the bacon and potatos over the cheese, then add more cheese. Once the eggs are almost completly solid, take a spatulla and start to lift up the edges around the side that is empty, this will be the side you FLIP onto the other. once you can move most of the empty side, you will put the spatulla under the middle of the empty side and GENTLY slide it all the way to the middle of the omelette. then you will lift slowly and try to create a half circle by folding one half over the other. turn off the heat and transfer it to a plate.  If done right, you just made an amazing breakfast THAT WILL GET YOU LAID! Dont ever underestimate a home cooked meal. it will get you in bed with someone 99 out of 100 times.

Terraria has different difficulty settings, so there is no steep curve. The same concepts are re-used throughout the game, so once you master it early on, your focus is set on three things. Building, upgrading, and exploring. The weapon variety is decent enough, that you can choose the weapon (or tool) to defend yourself.  Don't go back to 3D sandboxes after this.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"why play this piece of ♥♥♥♥ when you can read the entire bee movie script   According to all known laws of aviation,    there is no way a bee should be able to fly.    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.    The bee, of course, flies anyway    because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.    Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp… under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of…    …9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as…    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    “What's the difference?” How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody “dawg”!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal…    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up.",-1,1

105600,Terraria,"The gameplay is fun, and challenging, but it's no fun building up a large game file and then losing it the next time you turn on your computer.  This game has a nasty glitch that deletes your game files, seemingly at random. Although, I'm not sure if it's the game itself or Steam's synching mechanism because it seems to happen when I have to log back in.  Either way, it wasn't a good introduction to this site and frankly $3.00 (on sale) isn't enough to keep me invested.  Also, they try to say you can set up a link account to a third party server to backup your gamefiles or something, but, honestly, what's the point?

105600,Terraria,"Pros: Terraria is a simple concept but has taken a lot of the good elements from minecraft (mining and crafting) and added more complex aspects. The game holds more motivation to keep you playing. You have to defeat bosses to progress and find loot to defeat those bosses. The game is open world putting you in control of how or when you want to defeat the bosses. Everything in the game adds up to make you value the time you put in, keeping you coming back. You'll find yourself more immersed if you play with friends. If you don't like games like mineraft give this one a try regardless.

105600,Terraria,"This game is awesome.  For starters, it costs next to nothing and it's on sale every other day. Now, from the looks of it, you might say it's simplistic, primitive even, but you'd be wrong. Terraria has ridiculous depth to it, which you can only ever experience if you actually get it and play it your own way. I don't really think watching videos of someone else playing it will get you far because you're bound to do things differently. That's really the point of it all, to experience the wonderful world of Terraria on your own, to interact with all the eccentric NPCs and to fight the monsters that roam the land.  ...

105600,Terraria,"Exellent game to play... but requires time and patience to get to a stable state of enjoyable gameplay. First few hours are boring and tedious and you will be killed frequently during your first nights in Terraria. I recommend 'Large' scale maps as they offer you more resources to retrieve with the added land. Also. keep in mind that there is a new update for Terraria adding cool new additions like new enemies and night cycle ( Lunar? ) in June 2015. That will be the last major update that Red ( lead developer ) and his team work on before plans for Terraria 2 are set into action. I personally like to play online with friends but has a hard setup to do so... look up tutorials on google, youtube etc. But all in all, Terraria will soon become a blast for beginning players once you get the fundamentals of Terraria down pact.

105600,Terraria,Love it!,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Gameplay - 3.  Game it is like - Minecraft but 2D instead of 3.  What is this? - The game creates random worlds for you to play. Like minecraft you are looking for materials to make better weapons and armor, except your tools and armor don't break. You also don't need to worry about food. The game features about 10 bosses, 5 different events that randomly can occur and has days and nights are 24 minutes long. Monsters spawn really rapidly and are easy to defeat. You can create a town of NPC shops that prevent spawning. Pros - Bosses can be difficult Cons - It takes a long time to build up your towns, find bosses, get materials to spawn bosses, search online for hours to recipes and how to find bosses.  I played it a lot because a nephew of mine was banned from Minecraft and wanted a game we could play together. It was fun to see the look in his eyes when I'd undercover new items and new bosses.",-1,0
105600,Terraria,"When I first played this game, it was back in 2012. It's quite fascinating how it has changed. New bosses, weapons and items have made this game better then Minecraft in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft was a good game until I played over 3 years of it straight, became quite boring.   On the other hand, I like the style the game was created in. I don't know how to explain it but I guess a bit retro as in a sense of the colours it delivers (Link 1), bright and colourful like retro games are. (Super Mario for example).   In game experience can be described as creative, as you can build and create whatever you want in the 2D dimension. A vast variety of different blocks, lightings, walls. You can even rig your house up with wires and timers to torches and chandeliers and watch your cat have an epileptic fit behind you due to the flashing lights. In all honesty you can't run out of ideas :p  However the soundtrack in this game is stunning. Ice biome = Eerie and cold, the Ocean biome being calm and peaceful (Link 2). All created by Scott Shelly (Which is why the music sounds familiar). The guy has done a great job to set the tone in game.  All in all, this game is brilliant, the items, the crafting and the endless buildings you can create. Let alone the gorgeous graphics and music. Re-Logic and Scott Shelly ya' done a good job.  10/10  - Amida   Link 1:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296698554  Link 2:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFAOesKCN5s",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Im going to say this now, if you are considering buying this game, you should. why? because it's amazing that's why  I've often heard Terraria compared to minecraft, and I don't think that's quite accurate. Terraria is far more combat based than minecraft will ever be, as well as the major gameplay changes from subtracting a dimension. Don't go in expecting 'Minecraft in 2d'  Terraria is a joy to explore, the massive amount of content means that even with my nearly 200 hours there are still hundreds of items and enemies I haven't seen, so it definetely delivers on it's $10 price point  The combat (which is one of the most important parts of the game) is awesome, the controls are smooth and responsive, and the sound effects and music make it enjoyable and satisfying, another thing is that you will never be able to defeat EVERYTHING easily, the best equipment will only get you so far so a good deal of skill is required in defeating the later game bosses  Overall: Gameplay: smooth, fun, and easy to understand 10/10 Music: The tracks that exist are awesome but unfortunately there arent very many 7/10 Content: 150+ hours and still hundreds of things undiscovered 12/10 Devs: Great massive updates, IF a little infrequent, though they are already working on a 'not sequel' (otherworld) 8/10 Value: $10 for what is easily the biggest sandbox game I have ever played, I will never regret this purchase, and neither should you Art: the pixels may be a turn-off to some people, but I love the amount of detail the dev's were able to shove into this low-res package 9/10  I'll say it again, if you are even considering buying Terraria, do it, you shouldn't regret it.",1,0

Terraria gets compared a lot to minecraft. As far as having freedom to build and craft the world, I think the comparisons are fair. However, this is absolutely not just 2-d minecraft. This game has a really strong sense of progression. Both the player character and the world itself experience this. Players can create better and better weapons/armor so they can kill stronger and stronger bosses. But after killing a mid game boss (whom you summon by sacrificing an npc friend in hell), the world enters hardmode where the difficulty is noticably increased and new stronger materials enter the world. Additionally corruption begins to spread throughout the world, and can consume your home base if you do nothing about it.   One notable feature is the unique base building experience. There are a lot of helpful npcs in terraria but they will only be accessible if you build them a home to live in, after unlocking them through some game event. You can make the homes of your npcs as awesome as you want (I always go for the super building for everyone). This sense of game driven crafting is something I've always wanted minecraft to have, and I really love it here in Terraria. Additionally, there are occasional invasion events, such as the goblin army. Initially you will have to deal with these things manually, but eventually you can build helpful devices such as pressure plates to trigger arrow traps, autolocking doors, hot lava pumps, etc.   If there was one feautre I would add to terraria/the sequel, it would be to change the fact that a lot of the in game progression is just left for the player to discover. I used online guides a lot to supliment this. It would be awesome if this type of stuff was quest driven by the npcs. And even more awesome if the npcs could have their characters more developed.   I absolutely love the mix of rpg elements and sandbox crafting freedom, and would recommend this game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"At first I glossed over this game because it was 2D and looked unimpressive - I was wrong. I'm more pleased with this game purchase than any other. It's packed with content and things to do, find, build, monsters to fight, and bosses to beat. There are so many unique things with a generated world, the replayability it excellent. I've played solo and multi-player and loved both. If you've ever liked a sandbox, crafting, or even RPG type game, you'll probably like this.",1,0
105600,Terraria,i have nothing else to say besides that this game is AWESOME!,1,0
105600,Terraria,The most helpful mechanic in teh game: jumping.  So helpful I even created a guide for it,1,0
105600,Terraria,Nice game! Many good features &amp; enemies.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game is awesome! It's got a nice sense of creativity and battle together! If you want a game that will hook you for a while, Terraria is so worth the $9.99!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"It doesn't load when I want to play it... It says it's running but it never opens. When it does, it's fun.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"This game likes to ♥♥♥♥ you over whenever it wants to, first you get 3 heart crystals, then kills you because you were just a pixel too close to ice or sand or some thing. Hoever the pros and cons are present PROS 1. Fun game with freinds yes 2. Can be fun alone CONS  1. Game doesn't love you 2. Game does whatever it feels like doing 3. Unless you dont play Mediumcore or Hardcore you aint getting the good stuff 4. You will lose everything and not be able to do anything because you dont have any tools from before 5. Every time you are at low health/have a ton of good stuff, YOU WILL DIE UNLESS YOU TELEPORT BACK  All in all good game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Despite 'This is a ripoff of minecraft,' it's very unique.  This game is mainly about building/crafting, mining, exploring, &amp; combat. Items vary such as Marshmallow-On-A-Stick, to the Steampunk Jetpack, to the S.D.M.G (Space Dolphin Machine Gun). Terraria is very creative, and you choose how to move along. The game has so much to it, you won't get bored at the start (if this is your kind of game). I highly recommend this game, Good Luck!  Tip: Leave your doors open at night ;)",1,0
105600,Terraria,Is very good. Yes. Must buy.,1,0
105600,Terraria,Awsome,1,1
105600,Terraria,"Bruh this game perfect and epic at the same time. my imagination goes wild when i build things in this game from houses to APK farming.the amount of creativity is limit-less in the open world game, from starting off a house to a whole village or town then a massive city covering almost the whole map.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Hadn't touched this game in a while until an update rolled along... same awesome content as ever, loads of fun and tons of new things to find and do.   If you like creative sandbox type games you will probably like Terraria.",1,0
105600,Terraria,A very good game to play with friends! It makes more fun than some AAA games which cost a lot more than this. Plus it's getting updated with a ton of new stuff. You won't be disappointed.,1,0
105600,Terraria,great game   this game is maybe 2D but it is better than a lot of games with ultra graphycs it is like minecraft on steroids and 1.000.000 mods if u think about buying this game STOP and buy it!!!,1,0
105600,Terraria,This is a game that you must try.,1,0
105600,Terraria,i bought terraria and started playing i stopped playing about 7 hours later  good game,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Bought this years ago when it was on sale for 2.50. liked it and played it a lot. Put it down a bit later due to a lack of time.  After that it went popular. More content was added and I picked it up again.   Now i'm left with a gap in my life of 524 hours I will never get back. Thankfully that gap is filled with dead zombies, pumpkinmen, aliens and corrupted zerg like macrobiological (former) lifeforms.  I have no regrets. I'm glad I got this game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,New and fun updates makes this game fresh and new every update!,1,0
105600,Terraria,At the time of me writing this I have played terraria for 1571 hours. 1571 hrs = 65 days 65 days = 9.4 weeks 9.4 weeks = 2.3 months  Over two months  of gameplay...                 and I still haven't seen everything.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Minecraft Clone? Yes. Only Terraria fanboys will deny that fact. That however doesn't neccessarily mean it's a bad thing. It takes the best parts from it's origin, puts it in a new 2D coat and builds upon it by adding new and exciting things. The best part is that it does it whilst keeping Minecraft in it's value. Both are solid games, the only difference being the dimensional view and content. It's a matter of preferring action or building. Whether you're a fan of Minecraft or not, I recommend this game to everyone who isn't truly obsessed with graphics. It's one of the few games you really -HAVE- to try before being able to make a fair judgement - as this game will once again prove that graphics mean nothing when it comes to gameplay.  Update for nominee badge; this game still as good as the first time I played if not better.",1,0
105600,Terraria,nias history,1,0
105600,Terraria,I've been playing since 2012 and this is one of my favourite games of all times! totally recommend it! (if you can't understand the game just use the wiki it helps a lot),1,0
105600,Terraria,By far the greatest game out there i loved every single moment of it,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a brilliant game. I have both it and Minecraft, and after 400 hours, I can say with confidence that easily this is the better game. Just because it is 2D doesn't have it inferior, in fact Terraria runs much better on my Laptop, which isn't well geared to run games anyway. And the world isn't infinite, so what? Even if you have the smallest world size, you have more than enough space and resources to fuel your shenanigans. I would actually recommend the smallest size, so you don't go running around all for a long time to get anywhere.  Every single world is randomly generated, and with several different classes of weapons to fight with, you can play however you want. Killing enemies is great, espcially with late game weaponry. Boss fights, with most of them having a single night as a time limit, are intense and fun, and are a test of your skill and progression. Despite the action, building is still fun, and useful too, you can use traps and arena areas to help with bosses, and you can build houses for NPCS which can offer services to the player, such as shops and healing.  I have few complaints with the game. One is the lack of a tutorial system for players, who actually wants to stop and talk to a guide to find out what to do; tutorials would have you learn the game by doing. The game can get a bit grindy at times, but it is to be expected for games of this genre.  Overall the game is a fantastic experience. Don't even wait for a sale, its well worth the £10, and it better than Minecraft any day.",1,0
105600,Terraria,Like the whole idea of the game. Its just on of this games that are with simple graphics but with so cool gameplay. If i can change anything i will just add more things to the game,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Pretty cool game, influenced obviously by the voxel-based game Minecraft, but not as much as you think. Honestly, it does start out a bit dry, but as you progress through, getting better armor and facing bosses, the game just starts surprising you with items. That being said the game has no real 'True' ending, its infinite like minecraft, letting you make anything you want, with limited (unlimited if you have mods) resources",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Lots of game to be had. Structured in a way, but room for creativity. Great cheap fun for hours!",1,0
105600,Terraria,great game takes so much of my time,1,0

105600,Terraria,This game is guaranteed to give you most out of your money. I sincerely recommend it!,1,0
105600,Terraria,I really loved the game and still do. Not many games make me want to play them for so long. This game was for me the best sandbox game i played and i recomend it for anyone who likes that type of games. There are hardly any cons in the game. There used to be an issue with playing with friends for it was hard to set up if you werent familiar with setting up a server. After the game added an easy way of playing the game with friends i can finally say that i have nothign bad to say about the game.,1,0
105600,Terraria,This game has literally everything from Building to just being a phsyco path with explosives to just boss battles . Multiplayer servers are pretty cool they are dif from building to boss fights to just helping you out yunno but so far i am 93% done with achievements But i would totally recommend it ! [ i would recommend to do some what research if you are stuck the wiki is highly recommended ] ~G$u$,1,0
105600,Terraria,"You could say this is the 2D version of Minecraft but you get a LOT of brutal enemies to hurt you while you were trying to build a dream home.  You can do whatever you want (of course there is limitation), be it build your kingdom or village, do adventure, treasure hunting, kill friends, angered the dungeon guardian, challenge etc.   As for me, I like to do adventure rather than building so I always go out and seek rare enemies and find rarest treasure. I don't mind being underground for hours until my inventory has no more space",1,1
105600,Terraria,"This game is worth every penny, its alot of fun and it lets you bring out your building creativity in a game other than Minecraf.",1,0
105600,Terraria,Great game well worth the money! A must play!,1,0
105600,Terraria,"this game has given me some of the best moments of gaming on PC, with over 500 hours poured into making amazing works in single player, fighting bosses with friends and playing on great servers, I really feel that this is one of the greatest games on steam. If you were on the fence about getting it before, I can say with confidence that the new updates have given me the drive to start playing again.   10/10 Hands down the best game on steam.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I really enjoyed this sandbox filled with combat,adventure &amp; discovery. I thought it was so good, I wished I didn't have to eat, sleep or do my homework instead of playing this game hours on end.  I rate this game 10/10!",1,0

105600,Terraria,Terraria is for those that are looking for an open world game that is similar to Minecraft but with a little more flavor. Terraria offers an arrange of enemies and loot that will have you playing for hours.,1,0
105600,Terraria,It's a pain and confusing at first then it gets pretty fun and addicting,1,0
105600,Terraria,Everyone saying this is just a minecraft clone in 2D earns a punch in his face. This game offers a LOT more stuff than minecraft WITHOUT ANY MODS. It has a lot more of exploration because of the stuff you can find and it has bosses which you will want to kill because of their drops. There is no creative mode without mods yet and I do not know if there are mods for a creative mode so it can be a bit difficult if you just want to build stuff. If you play with friends It can get quit chaotic because everyone wants the good stuff ^^ But if you are playing with GOOD and FAIR friends you will have a unbelievebal ton of fun. Singleplayer is also fun but just not as much as with friends.,1,0

105600,Terraria,"Like a few other games I play, Terraria doesn't lead you around by the nose and glue you to a storyline.. It's all freedom in this game. Exploring the game world is your way twoards progress to find better weapons and materials to make your own enhancements and upgrades. Your deeds can attract helpful NPCs (like the nurse), and you can explore many different areas, like natural cave systems, or even find the ocean. This game is amazing to play with friends, especially when you're working together to build up your town and garner the materials to protect it. Or just to dig down and see what you can find. I highly recommend for team players.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"So far so great. If you can get pass the simply / cartoony looking visuals (which in many ways doesn't do the deep gameplay justice) there's a very deep gaming experience to be had. A day / night system (you won't want to be out at night), digging and building, water physics, secret treasures, rooms &amp; caves, crafting and huge random generated worlds to be explored (I've started with a small one and it's still freaking huge) meaning no two games are the same! Massively impressed with this so far and it makes a nice change from the (although also can good / great too) linear / predictable rinse and repeat games we're use too especially after completion. Gameplay-wise, this is part of what 'next-gen' means to me.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I could not hit that recommend button enough. This is by far my favorite game. I have at least double the hours on this game as I do on steam alone, because, being me, I have attempted to pour my savings into this great game. I have all 3 ports of this game, (PC, Console, and Mobile) and do not regret it. I would happily have paid $60 for this game, And, ladies and gents, the update, 1.3, is incredible. Hundreds and hundreds of items were added, and they weren't just to pad the game either. Half of them are completely original, and the extention items actually serve a purpose. Whether it's decoration, or an unlimited use, temporary stat boost, I have to say I'm really happy with the game.  Some features include: - Dying - Building a tiny dirt house - Suffering from lack of sleep from playing this game too much - Epic boss fights - An actual feeling of progression (this can be demonstrated by ripping through previous bosses that seemed hard to beat at the time) - Well balanced currency system - Innovative NPC's that are SO satisfying to discover - Around a dozen different types of torches (because why not) - INSANE power to achieve - Like seriously you can get a gemstone that shoots a giant solid beam of energy and shreads anything that stands in your path - A dolphin machine gun - Crazy events, from a solar eclipse to a martian invasion to 3 different types of moons (not just phases, like pumpkins and stuff) to giant death looking worm like space pillars surrounded by luminous shields of energy that spawn creatures from the far reaches of the universe (I'm not even kidding) - A fantastic magic system - And a charming, easy to understand layout  Now stop reading this review, and hit the add to cart button. Heck, even buy a 4-pack and play with your friends (assuming you still have some after playing hundreds of hours of the game) using the new steam intigration system that allows you to play quick and easy with others. And with this game at a minimum of $2.50, I can confidently say that this game is the best purchase I will ever make. Now buy it. Like now.",1,0

Why is this a good game? The amount of content on it is insane, and the last update 1.3 had a dlc amount of content if not MORE and the team of re-logic realesed it for FREE. FREE I TELL YOU!! Not only that with the amount of content in this game it's really worth at least 20-25 dollars, but it's 10. 10 dollars for tons of bosses and over 3,000 items.

You have different metals, different materials, tools, mechanics, you can create a town and have people move into it. You can dig miles and miles of underground tunnels in half the time you could in Minecraft. Multiple bosses, magic, and in my opinion, more of an adventurous feel to it.  The gameplay works well, but if you went from Minecraft to Terraria like I did, it may be a little hard to get used to. I found myself clicking on top of a block whenever I wanted to place something, but that's just me. Also, Terraria seems a lot more colorful than Minecraft, which I like. I love it when a game can pull out amazing artwork and backgrounds with vibrant colors.   Now, for your character. Minecraft had skins, which turned your MC character into something or someone else with a blocky feel to it. Terraria gives you complete aesthetic character customization at the beginning, with a slot in your inventory to put on hats and aesthetic accessories. You have three columns for different wearable items. I'll be honest with you, I don't fully know what the first column from the left does, and I haven't really paid any attention to it. The other columns however, are columns labeled 'Social' and 'Armor' respectively. The 'Social' column, as I said above, allows you to equip aesthetic clothing and accessories/jewelry to your character, and the 'Armor' column is self-explanitory.  Now there are a few problems I had with the game, but can be easily fixed. Mind you, this is in my own opinion (as is this entire review), and are just little things I found annoying at the start of the game.   1. This one is what you would call 'nit-picking,' but I got over it after playing a bit longer. You design your character at the very beginning of the game, and you never see that design again as soon as you put armor on. So, if that's the case, why have it at all? I'll answer my own question. To give freedom. You may never see that design again, but knowing that character is yours, and yours alone, is good to know.  2. There are a TON of monster that spawn when you begin. Again, 'nit-picking,' but, embarrasingly, I died a ton before I found a good place to build my house, and night never seemed to end. So it was zombie wave after zombie wave untill I built a house. For some reason, though, zombies don't spawn as often when you build up your town. It's probably something with the game.  3. MORE NIT-PICKING GUYS!! From what I've seen, there's no official game servers. Maybe I'm just so used to minecraft that MC's multiplayer has spoiled me, or maybe I'm just wrong and haven't been looking, but, as I said, from what I've seen, the only servers are the ones you and some friends make.   And that, basically, is my review on Terraria, and for all the nit-picking I had with it, it's a great game, it's cheap, and you will spend hours upon hours playing it, enjoying it, and discovering new underground caves while fighting bosses and upgrading yourself, and your town. I highly recommend this game to Minecraft fans and sandbox fans alike.  Thanks for reading guys!  I hope all the time I put into this helped you out a bit. I enjoyed writing this, and, even though it was long, I hope you didn't fall asleep while reading it.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraia is awesome! Not a ripoff of Minecraft, but if it was it exceeds Minecraft in the amount of weapons, monsters, armor, items, stuff, etc. It's just too bad that it's not continuing to be updated, which is why Minecraft is still more popular...",1,0

105600,Terraria,"So if you can't tell by the small amount of time I've put into the game, I love it a lot. Not a lot of people can get into this game as much as I can, but that's due to their finish and run to a new game ideals, but if you have creativity and a lot of friends, this game has a limitless amount of fun, and laughs, to be had. Just whatever you do, don't loot ninja the Vortex Shards. That's just rude.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Definitely my favorite game on steam. It's like a much more colorful version of minecraft, but with way better fighting and exploring mechanics (even though it's only 2d!).

105600,Terraria,"So yeah, over 200 hours in, its time for a review. I have never, ever had more fun playing a game for extended periods of time than i did with terraria. Terraria, for those who still don't know is a 2d sandbox game with no real ending. You can:   build forever   fight monsters   dig   fly   hang out with friends   dig more   explore your small/medium/large world   take on bosses   dig some more   tackle the extensive list of achevments   dig   DIG   DIIIIIIG  Now on its final large update, it is 100% worth the low price. trust me on this.

105600,Terraria,At first Terraria might seem like a 2D Minecraft but it is so much more than that. There are tons of weapons to choose from such as a flaming sword or a musket. There are lots of enemies to be seen in this game such as your basic slimes to your dangerous fire imps. There also difficault bosses to face. Terraria focuses more on adventure and action than building. There are tons of unique places to explore in Terraria. Dig deep enough and you will reach the underworld. Explore enough and you might reach a place that has been corrupted. You might even find a dungeon with an old man that guards it. All of this makes Terraria an amazing adventure action style game that you will never get bored of. I highly recommend you get this game.,1,0
105600,Terraria,Best 2d game of 2013-2016. ( I mean why not??),1,0
105600,Terraria,it is a great side scrolling game,1,0
105600,Terraria,"started the game, third night, 'you feel an evil pressense watching you', 1 minute later, i died 10/10 would die on first night again, this game is suposed to be an adventure game, not a sandbox game, so building is not that important, so dont say its a copy of minecraft.    The basic's of the game. in this game, you find yourself in a 2d world where you can make a massive assortment of weapons, everyone better than the last. you wont survive long in this game without good armor and weapons. you start out by making a house for you and npcs, but ill get into that later. there are many bosses for you to fight that you have to prepare yourself for with potions weapons and armor.  The npcs. to survive in this game, you will need to construct houses for npcs, they sell items unavailable to you anywhere else, npcs such as, the nurse, the guide, the merchant,and all other sorts of npcs to sell your items to and buy items from.  Bosses there are many bosses in terraria, each one stronger than the last, and the one you should start with, is king slime, but later in the game it becomes much easier to fight, as with most of the other boses in the game.   Overall. this is a fun game that you can play with your freinds and do all sorts of things, exploring, fighting, and even building, it is possible to make some good looking buildings in this game if you take the time to do so. this is one of the best games i have ever played, definitly worth the 10$, and it goes one sale quite often. i would reccomend this game to someone who is looking for hours of gameplay and an adventure game.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I have no idea what to say about this game other than it's completely amazing and the ways it's designed are simply incredible.

Overall though, great game.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Spend about $10 or get it on sale and get tons and tons of hours of fun, especially when playing with friends. Terraria is timeless, there's tons of content and the devs are still - after all these years - updating and adding new things like blocks, items, bosses and other general improvements. If you're into sandbox, adventure, survival kind of games and you're not set on 3D or 2D then Terraria is never a bad choice. You start with nothing and use your generated world to build your way up.  Even if you're not big on the survival aspects you can focus on building instead. Terraria has lots of different blocks to make your unique base.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a sandbox-metroidvania kind of game where you explore the world, get fun upgrades, kill fun bosses, and get killed in fun stupid ways. There's about three games' worth of content here and it's all rediculously fun. The game has extremely high replayability with endlessly versatile character builds  plus  your ability to influence the environment. I've seen people make world-size farms in this game before; it's insane.  The game regularly goes on sale for $2.50, but picking it up for $10.00 is never a bad decision. It's had developer support for the past several years, getting major content patches (so far) every other year. Support is proclaimed to have ended, but last time that ended in 1.2, one of the biggest, most well-rounded content patches for a game I've ever seen.  Overall, if you like (tangible) character progression, nonlinearity, and subtly dark comedy, the game is certainly worth a buy, and  definitely  worth your time.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Fantastic! Just perfect, I can't even put words to it. Play it, you won't regret. Play it with your friends for the best experience. 10/10",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I'm personally a fanboy of this game, but besides that the content of this game is just overall amazing. Seeing how the community is composed of a decent amount of people already tells you that this game is good. As for those who have never played terraria/ hate 2d games, try it out this is a great, fun game to play when you have nothing else to do. Sinking hours in the game might be a good idea to do, because as I said this game has a lot of content and it can be explored. It's really fun once you get one of the cool items like the hell pickaxe, drill, etc, others may contradict as to what I think is 'cool' but yeah this game has tons and tons of things to be done in it. Starting from a noob might be quite stressful, but overtime, the experience you get in the game will just get better and better as you explore other worlds from people online, in the servers that are currently online. Turning something what is considered crap into a masterpiece like from ugly, noobish blocks into, let's just say a tower emerald blocks ( i know there's better structures than that, but let's just use that as an example), you might enjoy building stuff. Building can overtime get boring, but there are many ways to overcome boredom, why not visit other people's world, demolish other people (if pvp is on) and as I said EXPLORE THE CONTENT. Sorry I couldn't tell much of a story regarding this game due to 'time issues' but as you can already tell I have sinked a decent amount of hours on this game. Thanks for reading, hope this review was helpful towards this fantasic game oh and by the way I'm not biased, the amount of other positive reviews says it all, and the community, too. WELL, HAVE FUN WITH THIS GAME ONCE YOU PURCHASE it.  So basically the bottom line is if you like building stuff, obtaining items every second, like playing with friends and most of all you appreciate the beauty of 2d games versus being a whiny, ignorant player, then this game is definitely something to consider buying.",1,0

More specifically, I wanna get around to about 10 more characters, and after that I will finish them 100% Look, this is a really good game. Hard to understand, at first, but a REALLY good game once you understand it. Tons of bosses, thousands of unique and special items (Seriously, other than the weapons and armour you make out of ores, every piece of equipment you find is unique) and a total of 4 main classes to choose from (though you don't lock yourself to one, you just do whatever you want). The music is pretty good, and helps set the mood for every single ocasion. There's pretty mutch a different track for everything, and it just goes to show how mutch the devs actually care. But anyways, you probably want a pros and cons list.  Pros: Practicly never ending content Fun and Solid gameplay Easy server making Pretty decent graphics for its art style Detailed character creation One of the most satisfying games to master  Cons: No tutorial. Things WILL be confusing at first, but it's not that hard to learn how to play The art style might be unapealing to some  Look, just get this game will you?",1,0

First of all - the game has a nice story to it, unveiling itself through three separate campaigns. There is Lance Henriksen playing You know who, whose voice You'll be hearing throughout the game. Arsenal of weapons for each race is as it should be - nothing fancy and new - everything You already saw in movies. All three campaigns use the same locations. It can be boring to see same places over and over, but You will navigate them differently, as every character moves differently. Most maps are too narrow and You can feel lack of depth and choice to pass them through. AI can sometimes be immensly stupid, be it xenos, androids or humans. Now, for 100% You will have to play multiplayer. It's almost dead, but don't look for games in lobbies - go to servers and search there.

It really puts you in the Aliens universe unlike anything since the original film, but with a healthy dose of Predator. Even the dreaded sync kills aren't that bad and help expand the melee system. It isn't always a guaranteed kill and it's possible to break free in certain cases.  Everything seems to work well and it looks nice to boot.

Without much discussion, this is one of the best games I've ever played in my life, I liked it so much that I completed again in 3 days, one of the few games that made ​​me spend more than 2 hours straight playing (4 actually).  The plot is very good and well done, the way it is presented to you, with a narrator telling and detailing aspects of the story all the time. It also has one of the best soundtracks, some songs are so good that sometimes I stopped playing just to listen to them. The art work is amazingly beautiful and well done. And the gameplay is kinda oldschool, remember Zelda, but without many puzzles, it's fun and challenging from beginning to end. Also the ending is brilliant.

107100,Bastion,"Note: This recommendation is based only on finishing the game for the first time. I may expand this once I fiddle with the New Game Plus and the rest of the content.    Well, what else can it be said about one of the most prominent Indie games in the past few years? Many good things have been said and I don't feel I can give this game the justice it deserves, but I can try  Bastion may have one of the better uses of narrative in the medium. Ruck's narrations can immerse you into the world and describe every event, action and thoughts in such a way that is not only interesting, but manages to inform the player without trying to info dump them. The way that is also structured makes the player feel like part of the world.  The story itself is a take on the apocalypse (or after the fact), but once the plot advances, characters get introduced and expanded on their roles and the truth of the Bastion surfaces, the game takes an interesting turn that I won't spoil, but that I will say can make the player think and there are critical points in the late game that show very well the integration of narrative and player interaction with the story.  For me, those are the main points of the game. But not to say the other stuff isn't competent, because the rest of the content is quite great. Gameplay is in the vein of Action-adventure games like of the 2D Legend of Zelda games and works very well, with good progression on the weapon updates, nice powerups with different kinds of combinations on how you approach the combat with different arms and good combat overall, though it can get a wee annoying when there's sometimes enemies everywhere and I recommend to play more with a pad than the keyboard (it works, but there's some dexterity required). The graphics are amazing and the artstyle by Jen Zee not only looks beautiful, but manages to create an aesthetic that is different, unique and creative from other games. Lastly, my god, Darren Korb's soundtrack, probably the other high point of the game besides the story and narrative, now among my favorites.  Overall, I love this game, there's simply not much else I can say to describe the experience I had with Bastion, which now I have among my favorites not only on Indies, but in general. With Indies sometimes taking flak (some deserved, some exaggerated), i'm glad games like this exist to prove what can be possible with gaming that many companies refuse to take the risk of producing.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"Caught in the middle of a Calamity that turned the world into ashes, the Kid departs for the quest to restore hope to the world and to the few that may have survived. You’re the Kid, and this is your story.    Bastion is an action game that has everything to be original and… fortunately, succeeds with flying colors!    The pros:   The beautiful landscapes are a treat to behold.  The array of weapons at your disposal make it’s easy for you to destroy it in the most creative ways. (Hey, it’s not in the contract we have to respect public property). Jokes aside, they do let you come up with various strategies, which makes the game feel more dynamic.  The soundtrack is amazing, especially the tracks with vocals. (“Mother, I’m here” is amazing.)  Some climax scenes have great impact and work extremely well with the soundtrack chosen.  The Who Knows Where levels are pretty cool challenges and fill you in on the characters’ backstories.  It has good replay value. There are two possible endings and, if you get into the gameplay and the idols challenges, you will want to get all the achievements.    The subjective:   The narrator. Although I find it a very original and interesting way to tell a story, especially when he changes the dialogues depending on how well or not you do something or on your decisions making it feel like he’s actually watching your actions, may be annoying for some.  Despite the fact I have zero complaints about this, sometimes it feels to me that this choice of storytelling made it hard to interact with the various characters more, as it feels like the devs didn’t want to break the whole narration feel by attributing each of them their own voice actors.  Which leads me to…    The cons:   There isn’t much interaction between you and the other characters. Because of the trips to Who Knows Where, you won’t find it hard to empathize with them as you’ll learn their stories, but I can’t help it but feel that a lot more could be done about them. Taking into account the context of the story, you’d expect the characters to be friendlier and connect a lot more with each other, which doesn’t happen because you can only talk with them when you find certain mementos. And I’m blaming the introduction of a narrator for this, as it’s his voice who speaks for the other characters, in the third person, which isn’t the best person to use when you want people to connect with the other characters.  Sometimes, you miss a lot of what the narrator is saying because many a times he talks when you’re busy trying not to get mobbed by 20 enemies at the same time, which is a shame. The narration is an important aspect of the game so it would’ve been better if they could time the dialogues to more idle moments so that you didn’t miss them.  The cursor. Even if you make your character face a certain enemy or object and attack, the attack won’t hit unless your cursor is also turned into that direction. Honestly, it’s not a big deal, but it is frustrating at times.    In conclusion, Bastion is an immersive, fantastic and, at times, surreal world that pays close attention to details and creative playing. I recommend it to everyone that likes fantasy settings and great storytelling.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Soundtrack is amazing! Gameplay is fun enough to pull you through all of the story! Not bad.   Gameplay is a bit narrated, like for example the Junkensteins Revenge in Overwatch, which is pretty cool.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"Fantastic story telling, cool twists and beautiful aesthetics.  A true indie gem.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"I'm not the biggest fan of the 'hack-and-slash' genre, mostly because, for me, it gets boring really quick. It always needs something extra, some deeper substance, to be intresting in the long run. I get bored easily if it's just beating enemies to a pulp and getting XP for it. That's why I wasn't really sure about 'Bastion' when I started out, and to be honest, it took a long while to get into it. But now that I've nearly completed it, I'm gonna go ahead and say it was a most excellent journey.  Many of the players have praised 'Bastion' for it storytelling and it's intuitive narration and yes, it is a good, albeit often-seen, story and Logan Cunningham is amazing as The Narrator. Many also speak fondly of the graphics; beauty and colourful it is, and once you get used to the level buildup, it's really quite charming. These are all elements that make 'Bastion' good.   For me, what made 'Bastion' special was the way the game constantly drops you elements and things, with which you can then build your own way of playing; you can choose which weapons to specialize in, which one's to upgrade, which Idols to activate and so on. It's easy and effortless and gives 'Bastion' that extra kick. I liked it.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"This game has great graphics, good gameplay, aweome music (point lemaign is taking the cake for me ^^) and a fantastic story in my opinion. It has a newgame plus and it will take you around 10 hours to beat it the first time if you want to finish all the training stages. The only flaw i noted is the story telling, although the story is really good i kept complaining about the fact that i couldn't read the subtitles while i was fighting at the same time. I'm not english but i can understand spoken english but when i'm focused on fighting monsters i can't really concentrate on what i'm hearing.  If you are seeking for a smart beat them all with an amazing atmosphere, colorful graphics and a raging little kid, then this game is for you. If you don't, well this game is for you!",1,0

Overall, the game kept me interested the whole way through. Its a relatively short game, about 7-8 hours, but there is a lot to do after you beat it and definitely worth the money.",1,0

107100,Bastion,*Update------ After beating the game twice i do have to say that i actually enjoyed the combat mechanics aside from the falling off easily on some maps and thus its a definitive buy if on sale!-------- Ill be honest this game looks nice and is different than most games although after a while it does get repetitive and not my cup of tea. I do enjoy the unique art style and narrative just the game mechanics and combat system im not too fond of. But if its on sale its a good buy just dont expect too much of it its just a 2d arcade type game 7.5/10,1,0
107100,Bastion,"Before i start this review i would just like to say that this game is AMAZING! There is nothing like it and it is worth every penny.   WHAT I LIKED  The graphics are amazing; I can only describe the scenes as a watercolor painting with stained glass influences. The sound immersed me in the game. The combat was also great. The weapon and enemy variation kept me wanting to play and it never got repetitive for me. The narrator entertained me as he announced what I was doing and why it mattered, but his sultry tones also kept me company. Bastion's a single-player game, but the narrator was my companion through thick and thin. Toss in some fantastic music and sound effects, and Bastion is a blast to experience. The best thing Bastion has going for it is that I was always surprised by what came next.   WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE  The ground in the level would apear as you walked along it and this would cause me to fall off the map sometimes if i walked too fast for it.  The curser and the arrows pointing for ranged weapons didnt line up so it was sometimes hard to make a shot.  The truth is that i didn't really dislike much. It did almost everything i wanted  FINAL VERDICT  If i had to give this a rating it would easily be a 9/10. This game was truly amazing and you dont get these types of games often. If you don't already own this i would extremely reccomend it to anyone. I got this game on sale for $2 and i can say that it was some of the best $2 i've spent in my life. I love this game.",1,0

107200,Space Pirates and Zombies,"Frustrating, tedious, hard. Sometimes SPAZ makes me want to eat my keyboard at times.  Yet I come back to it. Why? Why? Why?  Update: The frustration outweighed the fun, finally. I stopped coming back to this game. Too grindy later in the game.  Actually, I know why. The game doesn't have the most balanced mechanics, nor does the difficulty ramp up all that smoothly (more like, brick-walls on you if you aren't careful). But it's a 2D space combat simulator with a teeny little bit of RPG tossed in for good measure and a heavy exploration element, and by God's Bones, they dun make games like this no more.  There's lots of ships to unlock and lots of goodies to toss onto said ships, so at least if you feel bored using one sort of build you can swap it for another.  If you put in lots of hours in games like StarControl, Escape Velocity: Nova, StarFlight and Solar Winds, then buy SPAZ and enjoy it. If you have no idea what any of those games are, then you might want to pass. Then again, it's on sale at times for just a few bucks, so what do you have to lose? Aside from a few bucks.  Pros:  * Nobody makes these kinds of games anymore, OH WAIT, they did! * Lots of ships and weapons/upgrades to discover. * Big universe to explore. * Nice visuals and sound effects.  Cons:  * Big universe to explore. Becomes tedious after a while since systems must be unlocked one at a time. * Chunky and slow during big space battles, especially later in the game with lots of ______'s flying about spewing chunks. (*Spoilers!) * Space battles can end up near-stalemate battles of attrition, which take a long time to resolve. * Less story-telling versus games like EV:Nova, etc.",1,0

I'm very defensive over this as this game to me does Cthulhu wrong. Yes, there is a way to do him right and many games do it, but this one doesn't.)  Behold: its an 8-bit game. More and more I'm starting to find this art style to be absolutely lazy. You got games like No Mans Sky that exists with its amazing colors but this one? This one settles for blocks.  Right so its alot like Earthbound Zero. EBZ is very very hard, and is an RPG. CSTW is very very hard, and is an RPG.  So whats the big deal? Well, at least in EBZ there's a clear 'hey you're not ready for this area' line, in the form of the town Snowman, where you get terrifically powerful Wolves that you can't kill. Its its own area, right? But CSTW is like 'hey look you were fighing level 2's in this cave system, so here's a level 8 enjoy'  However, and this where the differences start: EBZ has a great story. This one does not. It came bundled with a second RPG in the same art style that I refuse to look at. Lovecraft fan or no, give this one a miss.  4/10",-1,1

107410,Arma 3,I recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. This game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. Controls are most fluid then Arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. It does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. Every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like RL.    I didn't log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the SC (Sector control) game mode and its fantastic. You gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear.  Il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.,1,0
107410,Arma 3,"I Gladly dropped part of my paycheck on this game, and ever since its release it has kept me entertained through the various gamemodes it offers. If you do happen to get tired of Wasteland, Altis Life, etc you can check out armaholic, and download many more mods and missions to work with. The game does have its bugs, but in reality every game does. They may or may not get said bugs worked out, but we can only hope. If you want to screw around on a MilSim that has many things to offer Arma 3 is the game you want to pick up.",1,0

This game brings up alot of mixed feelings from my time in military service; but humanizes it all in goofy and offbeat player to player combat. the balistics are pretty on point for small arms and heavier weapons; and the tutorial &amp; story mode can be beneficial to all who are new or experienced. I have never met so many young and old players who cooperate more and utilize military terminology, communication, direction and land navigation to enhance my total gaming experience. From gathering a stockpile of marijuana on altis life rpg to spotting a target's range for indirect fire or close air support; Arma 3 has very little in terms of flaws; but it is those small flaws and minor server glitches that add even more to the fun variable.",1,0

Altis seems like they didn't know what to do with cities, and they kind of all look the same. The rest is farmland, basically.

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 has a large variety of mods that all share there unique and exciting moments. Personally, I think the best mods are Altis Life, Exile/Overpoch, Wasteland and King of The Hill.  Altis Life is where majority of my hours are from, roughly 700 hours, I have had endless memories that I will remember forever on Altis, I played on GSN gaming under the alias 'Rust' and other names.  Exile and Overpoch are more of a survival zombie based mod, it is very tactical if you let it, has great base building mechanics and a great economy system, I would highly recomend this mod to those who are experienced with Arma.  Wasteland and King of the Hill are just bloodbath servers, Wasteland has a lot of AI missions to give you nice perks while King of The Hill is a hold and secure mod where you can train your firing.  If anyone is wondering to buy the game, I would highly reccomend buying it, even if you don't have any friends that will play it with you, I have no doubt in my mind you'll meet some great people here on Arma.",1,0

I would recommend if you play with friends, coop missions in the series are some of the best fun I've had in a game. Arma 3 is not an exception.   There is no lack of content with mods and the workshop. The community is great in the smaller servers, but on the large life servers and King of the Hill it is crap. Turn off VON in the options so you don't have to hear randoms screaming about whatever on the mic though and it can be some great fun and incredibly immersive, feeling like a small cog in a war machine.

AI is still a little clunky as of Feb 2014, but we are still in BETA.  The game is huge! Just like its predecessors this game is larger than most training areas in the Continental US. And it is also huge in the number of weapons and vehicles that are playable.  Not necessarily for the Battlefield/CoD crowd. Although you can change/edit settings to make the game that way, in general it is much more methodical.  My major complaint is that when I put 2 Infantry Squads under the control of a Lieutenant, the formations became very funky. Instead of 1 squad on each side, the two Squad Leader fireteams were on one side, and the two Team Leader fireteams were on the other. But again, game is still in BETA.

107410,Arma 3,"My friends and I got on one night and spawned in to find our side had just purchased a GhostHawk. We link up with thier squad and go around taking various points and doing the missions for hours. I managed to scrap up enough cash to buy my pref setup: A DMR style sniper( like the quick shots vs the high stopping power) with a thermal scope and suppressor. Had my ghillie OC and was ready to stalk a mofo.   After awhile and a quick fire fight at the Altis airport most of the squad got off, including the ones who bought the chopper. They gave it to us with me at the reigns and off we went. We continued for awhile taking points and objectives when we caught a stray bullet. No big deal I thought. The ENG light went from yellow to orange and I thought to myself better land and repair it. We had several Repair Specialists in our squad still including myself. So i find a clearing in a valley and begin to sit it down.   Hell broke loose. In third person about 50ft from the ground the left side of the helicopter erupts into sparks as tracer rounds rip through the chopper. The ENG goes red. The rotor goes red. The intrument panel cuts out completely. I slam the chopper into the ground and we jump out. Luckily their was plenty of cover landing only several feet from a bunch of rocks(not as intended) and we split up. At this point, its dark. Like, dark dark. Everyone is asking where are they!?!? I whip out the DMR with my thermal and scan in that general direction. There's at least 15-20 as they are scattering all over. AI's none the less but for those of you that have never played Arma, the AI's are often more deadly than the player, when they can see you. I instantly start popping off shots. At this range of about &gt;100m they drop like flies, although the DMR doesnt have the stopping power of most single shot rifles the 7.62mm round is plenty enough. The enemies instantly drop to the ground and start crawling towards cover. My sqaud still yelling where are they and all I can do is scream HOLD ON right back. DONT MOVE. None of the enemy has night vision. Another perk to the realism of Arma is the details. If an enemy has NVG, you can see them. I precisely take out the rest of them one by one. We repair the chopper(not quite as easy as a simple reapir but thats a story all to itself lol) and off we go.  The thing is though. You had to be there. You have to experience unscripted scenarios like this for youself. The best part about the entire thing was the atmosphere. They couldnt see us bc they didn't have night vision, but that wasnt the only thing. The blades of the chopper were still spinning as these events unfolded, kicking up dust to the point that you couldn't see even with NVG. The thermal I equipped was perfect for this situation. Also, with the suppresor, they had no sound nor muzzle flash to alert them to my postion. Even though I had other squadmates, none of them fired their weapon. The enemy, although AI, had absolutely nothing to go off of to help them. Situations like this, this exactly, are what makes Arma so special. We're talking scripted perfection in a completely unscripted game. We just so happened to fly over the wrong valley. I just so happened to equip what I had. You don't think about things like this when its all laid out for you in a single player campaign. THIS is what makes Arma so special. Do I recommend this game?!?! ♥♥♥♥ing absolutely.",1,0

This means everything is very realistic. From bullet to drop to flying helicopters everything is difficult at first. It took me a while to master basic skills like moving, shooting, sniping, and flying. If you are looking for Call of Duty or Counter Strike you will not find that here. Instead you'll find a game where you need to hide behind cover, your bullets might bounce off an enemies gun, and you'll need good teamwork. Although I've heard the multiplayer is very fun. I have never tried it. Singleplayer is awesome however especially if you look up youtube tutorials on how to use the in game editor to make your own scenarios for yourself. This game is quite frankly for serious gamers who are willing to put about thirty hours or more to learn the basics or people who really want to have a realistic combat experience.  10/10 unlike any game I've ever played.",1,0

107600,Waves,"An excellent game in the vein of Robotron and Geometry Wars. The gameplay is great and slowly ramps up to give you a chance to learn how to best approach each of the enemy types you face. It has a great feel with points, powerups, and bombs.

Alan Wake is a gorgeous game with a tasteful TV feel to it. The plot is simple but interesting, plus I like how manuscripts add depth into the story. I also love the way key items are subtly lit because I'm not the type of player that likes spending hours pixel peeping to discern usable items.   The only downside is the motion blur, since I suffer from motion sickness easily. But that didn't stop me from finishing the game though! Highly recommended!",1,0

The mood and atmosphere is dripping with a dark and gothic feel. The enviroment itself was molded into a main character with its own personality which ranges from calm to menacing, but always so stunning that it keeps you captivated for hours on end. The characters are memorable and the voice actors well chosen for each part. This game is a must play for anyone who has enjoyed television shows such as American Gothic, X-Files, or Twin Peaks; and honestly, it's for any player looking for a dark story driven game that will stay with you long after completion.",1,0

(what's the plural of thermos??? Thermi?) It's very ode to the Silent Hill storyline too just less gore more spooky shadowy mist. Cutscenes and narration give this game a novel like quality and makes me feel like I'm playing a game Stephen King scripted/created.

108710,Alan Wake,"Alan Wake places writer Sam Lake’s talent front and center here allowing him to do what he does best. Craft an engaging story in an interesting place. Remedy takes a great risk by splitting the game up into chapters but I think it works in their favour, communicating to the player that it’s OK to take a break and preventing burnout. The cast of characters in Alan Wake run the gamut from over the hill rock stars to smitten diner waitress’ but no one feels out of place as the story of Alan’s vacation on Cauldron Lake is unveiled. The gameplay mechanics are serviceable but they never really get the attention they deserve and remain largely static throughout the game. You can see the last vestiges of the open world game this was supposed to be and while it is a shame that the game was pared down, what was released is still an interesting experience and a fun game to play.",1,0

In the end, I HATED the game, I liked the story, but the game frustrated me and I now HATE THIS GAME. Expansions are stupid too, they add nothing to the story, and are just more of the same frustrating crap.  Could be really frustrating at times with just a swarm of enemies, but most of the time they were easily manageable. If they made it so you had more freedom, and varied what you had to do, it would be a must have.   Graphically it was pretty.  I would only pick this up on sale.",-1,1

If I was a member of Rockstar's PR department, I would pull this game from the market and bury all copies of it in a hole in the desert.

111800,Blocks That Matter,"Blocks That Matter is a puzzle game with some platforming involved. The Adventure Mode has about 40 levels total, and there are also about 20 optional bonus levels to be unlocked as you collect hard to reach blocks locked in chests through each area. You are also given access to several bonus levels that have tie-ins to other games that were included in the same Humble Bundle that must also be unlocked. If all of those levels were not enough, you also have access to numerous player-made levels that are available for download in-game. The artwork is cute and interesting to look at, but is not rich with much animation. The main character is a small robot by the name of Tetrabot, and it looks very much like a little clothes washing machine. The puzzles aren't too complicated, but I do find myself restarting each level many times in order to get them right. Especially the last ten or so levels are quite difficult and will require your focused thoughts and attention to hit upon a solution. Your goal is to manipulate blocks in the environment in order to gain passage to other sections of the levels and to exit through portals. The music is very good, and of the ambient chiptune genre. This is a relaxing game, and even its storyline is cute and fun. The chests (containing video game history trivia blocks) scattered throughout each level are mostly very difficult to reach, but they are not required to proceed. The premise of the game is very creative and does not resort to cheap gimmicks or pretentiousness to accomplish its goals. All puzzles are intuitive and logical, challenging the player in the most adequate of ways. Some levels are significantly more difficult than the majority, and you will retry many, many times, until you are able to pass it, but this does not subtract from the overall quality and enjoyment of the game. For completists, there are dozens of hours to be spent with Blocks That Matter, with all the additional content made available as bonuses and for free. The ending was adorable and continued to showcase the artists' distinguished style. Even for someone such as myself, who does not enjoy puzzles as a whole, appreciated, rejoiced, and experienced hours of entertainment from this puzzle platformer gem.  Blocks That Matter is good.",1,0

Then the game opened up in windowed mode, and I tried to drag the game into a corner of my screen, because that's how I prefer it. I got about halfway there before the game stopped loading assets and tried to get into the menu. The game locked up. For a minute. Hitting the red X in the corner to shut it down did absolutely nothing, I had to give it the three finger salute to get it to ♥♥♥♥ off. Subsequent attempts to move the window were entirely futile; I can't even get the game to accept moving the top bar so much as a pixel because as soon as I tab out to get my captured mouse cursor back the game throws a shitfit and locks up HARD.  This game is such an attention ♥♥♥♥♥ that if I go outside of the game for so much as a second I have to give it a three finger ♥♥♥♥ you just to get my entire computer back.  I don't know what the game is like. I can't even get that ♥♥♥♥ing far in the ♥♥♥♥ing game, because I can't put the game window where I need it to be in order to play.  So ♥♥♥♥ this game.

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"What can I say about The Binding of Isaac. This is by far the best indie games of 2011 I have played. Old school NES Fans, you will not be disappointed. This game has a somewhat resemblance to The Legend of Zelda's dungeons. Even newer gamers will appreciate this addicting, simple yet complex Rogue-Shooter. Coming from the makers of Super Meat Boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises. Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game's price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 4,99€ you can't go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple.  A little game with some really good working dark humor. It's very difficult but that's what makes it lasts for soo long. Very addictive game with a high replay rate.",1,1
113200,The Binding of Isaac,"The Binding Of Isaac is a simple but fun indie game.  You play as a young boy named Isaac who is forced to face the evil beings of his basement and further on. There are several stages, but to continue each floor, you have to beat a boss. The dungeons and rooms are randomly generated, so that each time you play everything is different. The creator did an amzing job with this point.  There are several characters to unlock, by completing challenging objectives to play as them.  Lots of items inhabit the dungeons going from a rail from pointless to very helpfull.  This game is amazing without the dlc, with so much contect and area to explore each time you play.  Few rooms contain slot machines, a devil, and many more.  I find this game amazing for its price and would pick it up any day. An absolute well done to the team who made the game.

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"I wrote this a couple of years ago. While it was true at the time, there is no reason to buy this game. Instead check out its sequel: The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth. In comparison, this game is horse ♥♥♥♥.  By far the best value for money on Steam, The Binding of Isaac guides you through layers of depth and despair. The main story is that the child, Isaac, must flee through the randomly generated levels of his own basement to escape his homicidal mother. The rooms are filled with terrifying monsters and Isaac must fend them off by shedding his own tears. At the end of each floor, there is a boss room and there are many different kinds of optional rooms that will provide Isaac with powerful bonuses or fearful punishments.  The game is fiendishly difficult, with a health meter shown as a few precious hearts. Once you die, you have died for good and you’ll have to start afresh. The game has about 200 items that change the stats of the player as well as provide extra methods of survival and by the later floors Isaac should have a few helpful assets to help him achieve victory. At this point, the game will get LONGER and HARDER, so it really is a game that will keep bringing you back for another Isaac run. The DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, is an absolute must have for this game, as it adds 75% more content to the game in levels, secret room types, items, enemies and bosses. If you’re looking for a cheap game to last you a long time, this is it.",1,0
113200,The Binding of Isaac,"The Binding Of Isaac is the kind of game you might ignore at first, believing that it's nothing out of the ordinary. On the first glance it kind of is, but when you dive deeper into the game and learn it's secrets and strategies, this can become one of the most addicting games you have ever played!  The thing that The Binding Of Isaac does so much better than any other game is that the learning curve is perfect. You will die a lot on your first tries, but as you progress farther and aquire new items. you'll not only notice that the level of difficulty is perfect, but you will also notice that your will to beat this game strenghtens through every playtrough. This game has perfect balance between items, which makes sure that you will not get overpowered or underpowered for the battles you encounter. You will never feel cheated by the game either. Controls is the most important part of any game, and this is something The Binding Of Isaac does wonderfully. They are simple enough that you can pick it up and play, leaving the advanced parts of the game to be in the game itself, and not in its controls. The best part of this game lies in its randomness. every playthrough is different. Dungeons are randomly generated as you play and the items you get are different for each playthrough, thus making every playthrough feel different than the other.  Would I recommend this game? Yes, but it's not for everyone. This games graphical content and rouguelike gameplay can be a huge turn-off for many players, which is a shame, because this game is a lot more than your average 2d 'shooter'. It's a game that feels average at first, but as you invest more time in it you'll eventually come to love it.  Graphics: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Controls: 10/10  Content: 10/10 ---------------- Overall Score: 9/10  + Great atmosphere + Excellent controls + Addictive gameplay + Perfect balancing + Great Randomization",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"I have no idea why everybody gushes about this game, it's crap. Strip away the grimdark and the slighty better than usual indie-♥♥♥♥ graphics and you've got an extremly shallow dungeon-crawler / shooter that wouldn't be much out of place gameplay wise on the Atari 2600, which similarly uses it's difficulty as a cruch for it's lack of solid gameplay. Also the 'go google joy2key' gamepad support is beyond lazyness from the devs (joy2key is not a free product)",-1,1
113200,The Binding of Isaac,"A delightful and somewhat twisted indie game that reminds me of the days that I would sit on the computer in the public library for hours so I could play flash games.

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"I bought this game during a flash sale. expecting it to be pretty good considering how talked up it is.  So far I haven't been impressed. Limited resolutions are one thing. When the game doesn't have native controller support but goes on to tell you to use JoyToKey to get it to work, I think that's a bit of an insult. I know that an option exists to enable gamepad support on games that don't have it, not putting in the support because a third party provides it and then making a point of saying that it's possible is just lazy on the developers part.  When it comes to the gameplay, I'm not impressed. You can make the excuse that it's just a flash game but rather than make the game seem better, that excuse makes it seem like the game should have been just put on a site like Kongregate and allowed to be played for free.   Compared to games like Rogue Legacy and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe, this game is very lacking. You would be better off getting one of the others. Gunpoint and FTL are two other games within in the same price range that are way more enjoyable than this.  This game really reminds me of 'Dot Dot Dot, a game review by AXMAN13' (check it out on youtube if you don't know about it) as those are the kind of emotions that are brought up when I play this game.  tl;dr Get something else. Even the $2.49 that I spent to get this game seems like it was way too much to pay.",-1,0

After a mere 1 hour of gameplay I myself retreated to the basement of my own to continue playing, while my mother kept banging on the locked door with the intent of what I can only assume to be my demise. This was exactly 2 years ago and I have not stopped playing, nor left my basement since. My mother is still trying to kill me, or so I think. I have not eaten or drank anything as deals with the devil have allowed me to maintain my lifeforce by crying away the demons in my head that are trying to kill me (the only real threat) with such severity that they evaporate into nothingness.   I have become more and more efficient at crying the demons away, and may or may not regularly go in and out of consiousness over the past 2 years, and going back I would not have gone through the years any other way.  10/10 already pre ordered rebirth.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"The Binding of Isaac is one of the greatest Indie titles I have ever played. The top notch action of the game mixed with the randomly generated rooms and item drops keeps you coming back for more. The over the top story keeps you wondering if Isaac is really going to be safe from his mother's rath. In a traditional sense of getting stronger most of the items have a mass variety of effects. The thing that makes The Binding of Isaac special is the fact that its very hard yet extremely rewarding. You don't feel cheated out of dieing due to the fact that its a rogue-like and the possibility of the next play-through holding some excellent items to create a build that will take you to the end. Being able to decipher what the items pros and cons are is an essential skill that grows over the length of the game. The Binding of Isaac is interesting, hard, and rewarding a definate indie title worth checking out and mastering.",1,0

Don't let the bizarre art style put you off playing this game: granted, it's a bloody mess and it's really gross at times, but the game is insanely fun and addictive.

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"This is one of those games that is a blast to play... but you really, really don't wanna think about the implications of anything you see onscreen.  The gameplay is Rogue (or maybe Nethack, or ADOM, or whatever roguelike you enjoy) meets Legend of Zelda meets a SHMUP. The graphics are sprite based, and since this game was built in Flash it looks like something right outta Newgrounds (it kinda is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing), but everything's well-animated and it controls smoothly.  The subject matter... well... it starts with making snide commentary at fanatical Christian fundamentalists, then moves to dead-baby jokes and toilet humor, and just gets cruder and weirder from there. It's not for those who are sensitive of stomach or disposition.  If you can get past that though, and love you some roguelikes, you might just have a hell of a good time with this game.",1,0

The controls are very easy, but make one small misstake and it will easily bite you back. It can be a little hard at first, but once you've gotten the feel for how to move and shoot, how to predict enemy movement this game truly transpires from just a regular game to a joyfull, endless and limitless possibility.",1,0

113400,APB Reloaded,"Well, where to start...  1. The game offers the possibility to adopt different gameplay styles, according to scenery. 2. Besides having, and of course, claiming to have a 'good system' to prevent cheating, there hasn't been a day that goes by that one does not come across, either by using macro's or simply Aimbot. 3. The cheating 'community' for this game is also constantly developing to overcome the system in play (check U n k n o w n C h e a t s ). 4. Crying, crying, sobbing and sugar... A typical found combination during gameplay, due to the dominant age of the players involved (mainly from 13 to 17), resulting in ghosting missions, chat rage, abusive use of /report commands, and so on. 5. Random stutters (from 1 to 2 secs of freeze) during missions, occurring in a spontaneous fashion. 6. LAG. Yeah... since 2012 I must recognize that it has gotten worse.  7. Just to end on some 'good terms': create or join a clan or simply play with a friend. This game becomes more appealing that way and creates a better experience.   Overall Rate: 5/10",-1,0

113420,Fallen Earth,"I've played Fallen Earth from 2012, and here's my Review and heres why most people don't know what there talking about when it comes to negative Reviews.  This game Defines Apocolyptic MMO RPGs as one of the greatest yet.  Here's why Players put all this foolish Negative Feed Back and Here's why:  Most new Players find it very difficult to play this game because it's not easy to play, It's challenging, most players want a simple and Easy MMO And if that's the case then this MMO RPG is NOT for you.  Alot of Players find it hard to gain chips, if your serouis about this game and actually take the time to explore the massive gameworld and see what's worth what, gaining chips is relativly easy easy for new players.  The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an MMORPG making it time consuming to figure out where to find certain matierals or if you have the chips just buy them off the auction if you have the chips to, and if there's any on the Auction. (Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)  PvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search. The thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.  Everythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.  Staff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @  Gamersfirst.com  rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.  Now my Plus's about the game:  The game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.  The game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed.  Again it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.  Overall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.  9/10",1,0

115100,Costume Quest,"Overall: Costume Quest is a cute and adorable game about the complicated relationship siblings have with each other, set against the backdrop of one of my favorite holidays: Halloween. While the battles in the game tend to become tiresome at some point, the game is short enough (both stories) to not become overbearing. The game doesn't try to be more than it is, and is definitely worth the playthrough. Recommendation is to get it on sale as it's been bundled several times. However, if you're in a position to pay full price, please do as the devs deserve it.   Rating: 9/10 - Details below  Story: In my opinion the story was absolutely fantastic. Humor was there and though I'm not a twin, I do have a younger sister and I appreciated the sibling rivalry though I'm ancient these days. Though the main idea is to rescue someone, and though that's not very original in stories these days, it was a well told story that kept me very entertained. Further, it allowed me to revisit the child inside me and remember that power of imagination and what can be accomplished and believed in.   Graphics: Though I'm not a huge fan of cel style animation, I was extremely pleased with this medium with this game. Too many details would have ruined the power of the children's imagination and the softer non-detailed aspect of cel animation felt like it lent power to the story rather than taking away from it.   Controls: Simple and easy. No issues there. - NOTE: I used an Xbox One controller.  Sounds &amp; Music: All basically well done. I didn't play with other music and felt like it complimented the game rather well.  Gameplay: One tiny issue was that the battles started to feel like they were more of jumping through hoops than accomplishing anything worthwhile. However, this probably has more to do with my lack of patience for grinding/leveling in games in general as I get older. Honestly, the game didn't drag at all really, and without the unknown of what knocking on the door would do, the game would lose part of the 'Trick' aspect so essential to Halloween. Only real complaint is that I couldn't advance the text faster during dialogue and was forced to sit and wait though I'd completed reading the sentence. Nor could I pause the dialogue if something came up.   Final Notes: Forcing me to read at one speed as I read fast, is something that definitely will annoy me. That being said, it's a very solid game that is worth the time and energy if you enjoy Halloween, sibling rivalry and the imagination of children. If you can afford to pay full price and want to support a good game, do so.",1,0
115100,Costume Quest,"4th favourite RPG of all time. I said it before and I'll say it again: 'Originality' is the one word that describes DoubleFine. How many games do you know that are turn based combat RPGs where you change your classes depending on which costume your wearing? Did I mention it's halloween, the dialogue is charmingly funny and the game's currency is sweets?",1,0
115100,Costume Quest,"Super fun and adorable game. Really short, but there is a DLC also. Game is simple, but it is witty and full of puns. I would recommend this game if you just want a quick, easy game that is incredibly enjoyable.",1,0
115100,Costume Quest,"Pros: -Charming Graphics and Music -Great Halloween Story -Great Family Game -Simple, but fun RPG  Cons: -Goes on a little bit longer than it should. -Low Replay Value (unless you want to make a Holiday Tradition out of it) -Repetitive Quests  Got this game as part of a Double FIne Bundle and enjoyed it from beginning to end (though it did drag on a bit). A fun little RPG with great writing, humor, and a big candy bag full of Halloween charm. If you want to feel like a kid on Halloween night, getting candies, pranking neighbors, and fighting goblins, this game is for you.",1,0

115110,Stacking,"A satirical commentary on child labour and industrialism coated in a Russian matryoshka doll... and another one... and yet another one. As is typical for Double Fine Productions the game is an adventure puzzler that revolves around solving problems with more than one solution being availible. The protagonist is very likeable, the graphic style is cute and the dialouges are funny and insightful. The gameplay, though sometimes not being too diverse, is intriguing and puzzling. The main idea is that the player has to stack one doll into another larger one. Every doll has unique abilities that can lead to solving the puzzle or can be combined with others. The story is not very long, but very heartwarming and critical of society. Although it may not be worth the full price, if reduced this game is a real catch!",1,0
115110,Stacking,"This game I bought on a whim because I wanted something fun and easy. This game isn't easy peasy, but it is super fun!!

Otherwise, the story isn't worth it.",1,0

115320,PROTOTYPE 2,Prototype 2 is a phenominal continuation of the first game. The mechanics from the first prototype were carried over an enahnced with amazing combos and new mutations that makes james heller the most elite killing meachine.  There is hours of gameplay mixed in with dozens of mini games and hidden collectables to enhance heller's power and make him godlike. The storyline to prototype has always been phenominal and does not need prototype 1 to know what is going on. The game does fairly decent job as explaining what has happened.   Some of the key highlights is that the play can now use 2 power at once intertwined in combos to make heller a devestating killing machine and you can summon brawlers to your aid.   The only con to this game is that it frequently crashed and saving every 5 minutes was required.   Overall this game comes highly reccomended when on sale.,1,0
115320,PROTOTYPE 2,Better than first Prototype in anything.  Prototype 2 has much larger place than the first one Prototype 2 has new skill which cooler and better Prototype 2 has greater enemy than the first one and many more...  but the the best than all of that... Prototype 2 has more swearing than the first one.,1,0
115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"A great game even though it has been out for many years. Great to come back to and be refreshed with destruction and carnage. I seemed to be unable to play now since I've upgraded to windows 10 instead of windows 7. From what I can tell it isn't compatible? That's a shame, but after the story this game doesn't have too much replayability anyway. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the game. There is a feeling of accomplishment to scale a skyscraper by running up the side to then jump off and smash into the ground crushing people beneath me. In this game you feel less mobile when compared to the first and it is a shame they decided to leave out the body armour, It was also enjoyable how you could mow people down with your shield as you ran. This is still an amazing game and to be honest I wouldn't mind a remastered version of the first or even a third game which shows the first outbreak of the virus or some more history from blackwatch.",1,0
115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"Prototype 2 takes the concept of its predecessor and basically improves every bit.  Traversal of the city is far less of a mega speeded cluster♥♥♥♥ than in the first game. Explosives and combos can now finally be countered, combat is more varied and fun, and the missions and story are more coherent. Also gone is the stupid web of intrigue which was just a pointless system of wasting time. Now instead you can hunt certain VIPs, which is a much more satisfying experience. Side missions and collectibles give you access to new mutations, which make your character stronger and with enough experience the protagonist can level up and improve speed, health and other stats in meaningful and also at times interesting ways.  This is easily one of the better and more gruesome open world games out there. The only caveat at least on Windows 10 is that in fullscreen mode in native resolution you are apparently not able to alt tab. That's more of a windows issue though I'd say. The other GAME BREAKING bug in the game occurs very early on in the 3rd mission or so. This mission will simply not progress, unless you can alt tab out of the game (set the resolution to lower as native if it isn't working), open the task manager and allocate only 1 core to the game. There are multiple threads online so you should be fine. That's also the only time this bug occurs. How the processors and the mission not triggering are connected, is beyond me though...  Enjoy your time with this fun open world brawler focussed on total destruction.",1,0

12130,Manhunt,"I'll admit, it's a bit messed up that I started playing this when I was just a kid, but I'm certainly glad that I didn't miss out on it. It's one hell of a game and stuff can be as brutal as you want it to be (my favorite). Manhunt has brought me many moments of terror and countless adrenaline rushes, and it would probably still do that if I were to play it today. Despite how controversial the game is because of it's content, it's not any worse than most of the games that kids are still currently playing. Although, this remains the only game where I have snuck up on a guy and carved a hole into his stomach with a sickle, so I could watch his intestines poor onto the ground. He deserved it though.  My Rating: 7.5/10",1,1
12130,Manhunt,When i was little this game scared me! This is a blast from the past!! One of ROCKSTARS UNIQUE GAMES!! Bloody/gory for its time and graphic.

Piggy is a hard person and the last mission is really hard with the heavely armed gang members.. DEFF GET THIS GAME!! AND THEN GO ON AMAZON AND PURCHASE MANHUNT 2!!!!  Pros Stealth or go loud Throw bottles to make distractions Nice animations  sounds and graphics are GOOD for its time Plenty of ways to kill  break a bottle and use broken glass on someone Gory and Graphics   Cons  bug crashes at the second guy you take down in game (literally the first 2 mins of being in the game) CAN BE FIXED BY UPDATING DRIVERS!!,1,0

12140,Max Payne,"It's a classic, that didn't age that bad. Sure, some issues about this game were outdated even when it got released - I mean: character models moving their lips while talking were thing that was introduced in 1998 with Half-Life (or maybe even earlier), but then again, it doesn't hurt your eyes while watching those models - like Thief games, for example. Maps are visually nice and created with head (although very linear, like the whole game) - there are no such things like street ending from both sides with a wall (like in Blood 2 or Duke Nukem 3D).   Gameplay obviously is still awesome, way, way better than in 3rd game, which turned out to be a piece of turd. The only thing that bothers me is that I have to - yet again - play the game on the lowest difficulty available, as the game locks higher dificulty levels and unlocks them after beating the game. Considering the last time I finished this game was in 2007 or earlier and I didn't even plan to get back to this game, it's hard to expect me to keep those saves around. It's too bad, cause I would really love to beat this game on higher difficulty this time and easy seems kinda... well... to easy. I have stormed through the whole 1st episode (that is also the longest, if I remeber correctly) in merely 2 hours, hardly loading any saves.   There's also the atmosphere of this game, which is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious, especially in the first episode. Storming through all those cheap hotels and flats full of junkie addicts, with constant snow outside is a really cool thing. I love to play this game during winters.   In general, I recommend this title to everyone.",1,0

1250,Killing Floor,"Tripwire Interactives Killing Floor is what you would expect of a polished mod, but doesn't exceed expectations as a retail game. It's good, but unfortunately far from perfect. A nice addition to the survival-horror genre though, and it has an attractively cheap price tag.Once a mod now a game on its own, Killing Floor confronts the player with hordes of undead minions threatening his character’s life. While being independent enough of zombie-shooter-king Left 4 Dead with features like sealing doors, character perks and weapon stores, the game itself offers little variety and a flawed AI.It's not the sort of game that future generations will gather to celebrate, linking hands and singing sad songs of fond remembrance. It is, however, clever, boisterous, faintly silly and relatively cheap.Hectic coop multiplayer game offers no story but straight–forward nonstop mayhem in stylish locations. Rich and balanced equipment makes the multiplayer clashes all the fun.Ultimately though, the sort of plotless killing gets old, or at least it did for me.A decent little title, and a testament to just how far you can take your hobby if you but try.",1,1

1250,Killing Floor,"Bloody and Brilliant!   After putting a 1000 Hrs Straight on it, I can safely say that this is indeed my preferred and great personal favorite on Steam. Its replay value is endless, with seven different perk classes to survive waves of monsters alongside others. Across many maps and custom content that keeps this game going. To all you haters - This game is never boring. (You just can't win is all...) Out of all the main games you can play on here, this game is worth the 20 bucks. And also has lots of cool DLC skins, weapons and maps that keeps you in check. Game can be challenging and unpredictable at times, loading and lobby searching can be tedious, and the steps to host your own lobby is not worth the effort and headaches. Other than that I cannot mislead you because many find this game Bloody and Brilliant. &gt;:D",1,0
1250,Killing Floor,"A simple concept with surprising depth, survive a finite number of zombies in each wave, and try to make enough cash to buy better weapons for the next one, All the while hoping to end up with suitably powerful weapons for the end of game boss. The different perks(classes) provide a great variety in the way you play this game, and an RPG like upgrade path. Different environments require different strategies as well. If you just try and blast everything, you will probably fail, so learning the different abilities and weaknesses of the Zeds is important. The different game difficulties require you to master new tactics and tricks in order to be successful. The achievements make you want to keep playing and the social aspect of working with friends is very satisfying. Single player also requires different tactics to multiplayer coop. I have been playing this for a long time now, and still get surprised at how unique each game can be. One of the all time best coop games ever. The setting can be a bit macabre, so not for younger kids though.",1,0

1250,Killing Floor,"My friend gifted me the vanilla copy of this game two years ago. And I still play it to this day. I love this game; And I love this franchise. This game has meant the world to me. I've made so many wonderful and lasting friendships with this community, and various players I've met through my two years of service. :3 With over 683 hours into this game. I still find myself wanting to come back for more.   The gameplay is simple to understand. You fight through ten waves of enemies; with each wave, increasing in enemy population, and difficulty. Then the eleventh wave is the boss wave. You are given a wage for every enemy you kill, and for each wave you survive. After each wave, you are given a minute or two to run to the trader, and procure more crucial supplies like ammunition, body armor, and progressively better weapons. There are 7 playable classes (or perks as the game refers them) with their own tactical advantages, disadvantages, and tier based weaponry. They all play a part in aiding the team in surviving the hordes of zeds that you will be facing.   There are 10 (11 if you play on custom servers) different enemy types with their own advantages, and disadvantages. After a while, the enemy scripting becomes REALLY easy to exploit. But this has never bothered me. I've always enjoyed cutting a bloody swathe through hordes of zeds with my guns, and my friends :3   The graphics by today's standards arent enough to really wow anyone. The gameplay and community has always been this game's strong suit in my mind.  This game has always been a staple in my library ever since it was gifted to me. And it recieves my personal seal of approval.   I hope that this review has helped you in your purchasing decision, or reassured you of the purchase that you have just made.

1250,Killing Floor,"This is probably one of the better 'zombie' games out there. Buy the game whenever it is on sale. If its not on sale, buy it anyway. This is one of those games where being a lone wolf will get you killed, believe me I've done lots of times and as the levels progress, you soon realize it pays to stay with the group. On top of that, there's a good variety of 'zombies' in the game and they manage to sneak up behind you no matter how good you are. I think a lot of the fun lies in the weapons and classes. I main a sharpshooter myself and its always fun being able to headshot 'zombies' with my trusty crossbow. Like something out of The Walking Dead. Also a lot of the DLC is totally worth it. Makes for even more fun killing the creepy crawlies.",1,0
1250,Killing Floor,"Possibly one of my favourite games on STEAM.  Perk selection and traits are fun and feel individual for each perk set, making you want to play different skill sets.  Levels are great, expansive and eerie which set the feel of the game.  Online play is actually really fun with lots of custom maps as well.  Would only ever heal you, not shag you.   9/10.",1,0

1250,Killing Floor,"I found this game to be more enjoyable than Left 4 Dead. In this game, you must group up with your teammates to survive increasingly dangerous waves of zeds. There are more weapons to choose from than Left 4 Dead and it also has classes that you can choose from which you must level up to gain bonuses to class specific weapons. The group play is solid as well. You and your team must choose a spot on the map to make your stand. You need to stay grouped up to survive the waves of zeds that will come for your flesh as there are simply too many zeds to deal with alone, especially in later waves. Different classes will have weapons that can take out certain zed types more quickly and efficiently than other classes, which makes it more important to stick with your buddies and to put together a group of varying classes than can handle any situation. A very good game if you love killing zombies.",1,0

1250,Killing Floor,"Killing Floor is that rarest of games - a horror game that I'll play. With regular updates and season-specific content, this is one game that you'll return to again. Because we all know that killing zombies can get a little old, but slap a hillbilly skin on the brainless horde and suddenly you rediscover your love for blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. With a shotgun, I mean. Otherwise that's just weird.  There are various 'classes' of zombies, ranging from the normal and mundane to the ultra-destructive. Whatever you call these different types of zombies (My comrades and I call the invisible cloaking zombies 'invisi-♥♥♥♥♥es' and the chainsaw-weilding semi-bosses 'boarheads' - again due to a Halloween content update) you'll laugh, you'll cry and you're hurl your way through kill them.

Now, almost 6 years later, KF is still one of the best co op games i've ever played in my life. It's not a hard game to get good at, playing with other people or by yourself, there's a great variety of modded content along with the official stuff released through the years by Tripwire. The hardware requirements are, of course, not really high, and although the graphics can look quite outdated, this doesn't stop all the fun the game can provide.",1,0
1250,Killing Floor,A very fun mutiplayer game. Very fun if you have some buddys on board. game has ton of contect ton of maps and ton of DLCs. Game never ends. I think this game needs drops like tf2 or csgo and you can earn weapons and stuff like that. But its a great game 10/10,1,0

The game is a sci-fi horror, blood and gore fest, (but not really that scary) and it actully got a story, though people don't really care about that. It takes place mostly in the UK where a mutagen have spread and have infected lots of people and the world is going under, and you and your crew needs to find the lab where the cure is. You just need to survive the endless waves of monsters and hope that you can reach the shop in time for the next hundreds of monsters.",1,0

12690,Hunting Unlimited 2010,"If you can get past the low graphics there's a very relaxing game here. The game goes like this:  1) Select your target animal(s), location and equipment.  2) Track your target animal(s). You can use an RV or a horse to get around the big maps, and binoculars/calls to figure out where your target is. You can also use decoy animals and scents to bring your prey to you. Most animals will smell/see/hear you from a long way off so you have to hide yourself well. You can bring a tree seat and hide up in the branches, set up a camoflagued tent or just lie down in some nearby bushes.  3) Wait. This can take ages so it's a good game for audiobooks/podcasts. Occasionally make a call (not too often or you'll scare it off). When your target gets close enough, bring out your weapon (there's a variety of rifles, shotguns and a few bows/crossbows) and shoot the bugger.  4) If you hit it in the right spot it'll die instantly, sometimes it'll run off and die of blood loss so you'll have to track it down. Tag your animal and it goes off to the trophy room.  There are also a lot of missions if you want something more structured, but there's a good variety of environments and animals to keep you occupied. You can also go to Africa and hunt elephants/lions for some reason. There's a modpack that adds new equipment, skins and weapons: go get that too. If you enjoy sniping games or enjoyed the hunting in games like Red Dead Redemption you might enjoy this.",1,0

12750,GRID,"For a racing game, it's a mix between simulation and arcade. The cars in the game have an immense amount of grip compared to other racing games (but still feels natural), this adds to the sense of speed the game already provides when you're able to zip around corners along with other race cars (More so if you race in the first person perspective like I do in this game).  From my standpoint, I like to race clean and try not to hit other cars and the AI in this game is very responsive to where you are in relation to where they are, there are few situations where the AI just straight up runs into you. If you cut into their racing line, they will for the most part, respond very swiftly and try to avoid crashing to you. AI provides a very good challenge.  Excellent game in general, for a racing fan like me it's a nice mix between arcade and simulation. It's preferable if you had a gamepad or a steering wheel because of the tight racing.",1,0

Now I know this game is an older title and I didn't expect anything spectacular to begin with but wow was I sorely disappointed with this. Thridly, the story I really did not get into the story nor did I enjoy what I did see. It all just seemed very generic all around with lack luster build up....

This game rawkz and if there'a any multiplayer left online then try it because for years this was, 'IT.' A very fun game with very stable online multiplayer capability.

13250,Unreal Gold,"Son, you stepped on the grounds of one the best games ever made in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ universe. Sit back. get the visa card, click the add to cart button and checkout. Grab a cola and play Unreal.   Music that is crafted very carefully, with the beyond golden hands of Alexander Brandon, with the unique lightning effects that you rarely see now in games (Exept an exeption for Cube and Cube 2:Sauerbraten, those are really great), epic level design that is better in some bases than nows level design, powerful weapons and different environments make a   beyond epic-mega-super-ultra-penta   awesome atmosphere that is can only, but only, belong to Unreal. For an example when you escape the Vortex rikers, and you see HyLevels Falls right in front of your eyes, which is amazing. The gameplay featured brand new elements like dodging/faking death. etc... and is old school. which is good, The amount of replay-abillity is very high, as you can play co op or DM, or many other gamemodes, and thats also because the UnrealEditor is very open. you can make weapons to maps to player skins and many more...   Unreal is a must play, must have.   I obviously give it a 10/10",1,1

There is some servers at certain times of the day where you can join a full match and it can be loads of fun.

Basically, you're an agent working for Uplink, an organization for freelance hackers worldwide, with services like news, Mission bulletinboard (where you get most of your contracts, jobs, etc.,) and a variety of upgrades including software, hardware and gateway upgrades. By following the news one can inspect what is going on, and can possibly even see one's own actions seen on the news.  The story is fairly simple, a company named ARC is seen doing some suspicious stuff and raises suspicions on the news and between hackers. Later on we see the #1 hacker of Uplink message the player (and every other agent,) telling that when they receive the message, they would be already dead. He then gives a password to an ARC server and wishes them good luck. The player has the choice of involving in the story, starting a 'quest', or completely disregarding the message from the now late agent, essentially skipping the main story altogether.  I see alot of similarities between this game and Hacknet, but the biggest difference is probably the focus of the two games. Hacknet involves a lot of story, while in Uplink it is rather lackluster, as there is more focus on the gameplay.  The gameplay is simple. You buy some software and run them. However, once you start them up, the server will begin a trace. One needs to 'bounce' connections between servers to make a huge 'link,' so that it takes longer to trace. When you are hacking into a server, they will start an active trace. When you disconnect, they will begin a passive trace, trying to use the 'bounce' connection logs to figure out where you are, giving the player a responsibility to remove logs from bounced connections.  The game is very punishing. In the start, when the player does something as simple as deleting files, when they fail a bill comes in the form of an email, telling you to send funds to said account. However, when it is about changing criminal records, hacking bank accounts and destroying computer systems, the federal agents come in. When you are traced to your gateway location, they go out and search for it. This forces Uplink to disavow all information about the player, essentially resulting in a game over.  However, i find the game quite entertaining, as once you progress, the stakes become higher and higher, but hacking becomes easier and easier. One slip-up grants a game over, so you have to be careful of everything you do. I have lost the game multiple times trying to get bank funds from one account to mine. Once you see your mistake, you learn from it, and you become a better player, know what to do so that this or that doesn't happen again.  I recommend this to people who really like something punishing, those who are determined to become a hacker that no one has yet seen. Those who are looking for challenges: the start may be a little hard, but after that it's easy peasy.  I rate this game 9/10.",1,0

15100,Assassin's Creed,"I want to like this game I really do, but its just such a ♥♥♥♥ poor job of converting it to pc its unforgivable.  Firstly it takes 4 menus 2 load screen and a conformation box to exit the game, which in all take about 40 secconds. The HUD is crap, its an xbox dpad, useless for a 1234 keyboard layout. the controls fair no better, it is a littral mapping of pad A = LMB, etc each button does about 3 things depending if your holding control or shift, I have 152 keys let me use them!  Aside from that, the game is pretty slow paced, building up to the assisintations, which isn't as bad as it seems, despite the game trying it's best to make movement not feel slow, becomes a chore.  It does have some spark to it, the climing animations is fanstasticly well done, and fighting is enjoyable, but you have very little connection with the enviroment around you, nothing ever changes or progresses, making playing it seem pointless.",1,0

The campaign can be boring or slow at times, as it gets repetitive, but it's never a huge issue. My main problem with this game is that the PC port is terrible! I haven't had any issues with crashes but there are constant glitches through the game, such as death during the leap of faith jumps, or enemies flying all over the place/off the screen when hit. My character has also experienced these glitches, flying all over the place when knocked down or othewise hit. I've had to play through the final boss battle 3 times because of these issues. Also, the controls are a bit stupid, and don't always work as they should, with the wrong moves being carried out, enemy blocks missed, etc. Overall it's a fun game but be prepared for some stupidity.",1,0

Instead of rolling up bits and pieces of the world into a ball, you create an ambulatory humanoid pile out of the things you run into.   I hope they introduce more of the fun stuff from the Katamari games in the future. I really liked the index that kept track of the things that have been captured during gameplay. Gave me the urge to replay levels in the Katamari games in order to fill in the blank spaces. I do like that they have trophies for acquiring certain things in some levels, but it's not quite the same.",1,0

Base-jumping in a surreal setting can only become fun when the game-feel is right. Does it feeel like you're falling at 9.8 m/s^2? Does it feel like wind is blowing through your button on windbreaker pants? Does it feel like you're actually deploying and controlling a parachute down to your landing? Yes, yes, yes and no.   The game is reminiscent of sonic the hedgehog in a way, it's super fast and agile (movement wise), level based ,and very heavily emphasizes 'points'. The humor in the game is very smartass but in a way that feels like they're being a smartass with you rather than towards you, and its honestly one of the better parts of the game itself. The amount of variety in the levels as well as different routes through the levels give the game some solid replayability while you go back through and try to get higher scores on levels you've maybe passed up too fast. It is very hard to 5 star every level and so eventually, you will hit a brick wall where you can't finish buying all of the levels because you've run out of points and run out of levels to earn more points. It's really fun when you get into it, until it starts getting tedious. I could see this game being more fun with friends (actual friends in person, with a game controller, passing it around), but alone, I can only play in 10~15 minute bursts.  Overall: 6.5/10",1,0

Okay, first I bought the game on a sale, back when I could sell a TF2 item on the market at a moments notice to buy I game because I actually traded :P it wouldn't boot, something about PhysX, I just abandoned it.  A few years on I attempted to play the game with my new GPU, similar if not exactly the same problem, I was determined to fix the problem at this point, I read forums, messaged support teams and completely deleted important files from my PC, in the end I downloaded and installed the Nvidia Legacy Drivers which allow you to play games that only support older versions of PhysX, the game booted and ran like a dream.  Running at max settings on a Nivida GeForce GT740 this game runs as smooth as butter, stops at the built in frame cap of 60FPS and the card doesn't miss a beat, and never drops below 59, the graphics in this game are beautiful and the animations are very smooth and I haven't had many problems after I got the game running.

1690,Space Empires V,"Pros  - The game has an incredible number of customization options and offers a wealth of variety in viable strategies, particularly if you're using the balance mod practically everybody seems to be using. You can manage fine details of your empire's war machine that most games would abstract, and the game is clearly aimed at people who get giddy at the prospect of developing and testing warships to maintain an edge over current and prospective enemies. - Despite the dated graphics and sound design, fleet battles manage to be enjoyable, and I've killed hours just messing with designs and testing them in the simulator. The weapons have a good amount of variety in their look and feel, and the encouragement toward mixing specialist designs in a fleet means that the enemy's fleet composition can significantly affect your tactics in the field. - The AI will happily sign my Treaty of Imminent Backstabbing and praise me as a peacemaker, because the AI cannot comprehend the English language (I guess that's kind of a con, but I've never seen a game with AI that could deduce when it was being threatened or insulted through a text prompt, so I'm just happy for the source of amusement).   Cons  - You're not really given a choice in terms of how much detail you want. You're going to engage with all the detail, or you're going to lose. The learning curve can be very steep, and the UI is not friendly to new players. Forget not holding your hand; SE5 is pushing you down in the street over and over and laughing at you while you try to cross. Enjoy giving orders tediously one at a time across your huge empire until you figure out queues, because the game isn't going to nudge you in that direction one bit. - The balance mod is almost necessary, because the base game doesn't feel like it was balance-tested sufficiently, and the built-in AI is pretty much useless. Even with the balance mod, the AI doesn't have a good chance against a player with at least a decent understanding of the system, which only makes the transition from single-player to multi-player less comfortable, because if you're used to fighting the AI, human players will kill you before you even figure out how they built so fast (it's spaceyard rushing and their management of that emergency build thing the game never hints at the importance of). - There is only war. That depth I mentioned earlier doesn't extend to politics, economics, or anything else like that. Your empire is a machine to kill other empires, and everything else just kind of feels bolted-on. If you don't enjoy designing ships to patrol spacelanes, or you get bored of it, there's not much to fall back on. You can win through diplomacy, but it's far too easy to be any fun.   Bottom Line  If you're looking for a combat-focused space 4x that's so deep it hurts, SE5 is one of the best I've played. You definitely want the balance mod, though.",1,1

17330,Crysis Warhead,"The expansion pack to the original Crysis takes the player across to the other side of the island and gives you control of a different member of the team from the original game.  Graphically and game play wise it's very much more of the same when compared to Crysis, which is a good thing. Story wise, however, the action all takes place in between the mid point of the first game through to just before the final chapter of the first game. As a result it's possible to finish this in half the time it would take to complete Crysis.  If you've got Crysis already and want more then I'd say get this if it's on special offer, but wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.",1,0
17330,Crysis Warhead,"Good old fashioned Crysis game, nothing much to say,  - Shoot to kill, - Story is much better than the actual gameplay - Gameplay is much more interesting if you try to sneak, but it takes too much time and it isn't really worth of it since you get nothing for it..  My suggestion: - Buy on sale, Full price is still too big for what game offers",1,0
17330,Crysis Warhead,"Since my previous review got minused a lot, I think people didn't understand my point, as I put it in two lines. Ok, here we go, a full review.  Crysis Warhead and Crysis Wars are two separate games in one pack. While Crysis Wars focuses on 64 players high-speed mayhem, Warhead appears to be a spin-off from original Crysis game. A very sloppy spin-off. From narration, ridiculously long and boring cutscenes, to obviously badly designed parts of maps, this... game feels not like a game, but a desperate urge to squeeze a tiny bit more money from bright and proud name of Crysis Franchise, sold by EA and made by some group of part-time students instead of the team behind original Crysis. Action and combat is still the same, same AI, same enemies, same decorations placed in different order. Oh, hey, look, you can shoot akimbo smgs. Great, another useless feature on fourth, max difficulty. But the plot? Narration? Cut-scenes? I wish there weren't any, instead of that boredom.  On the other hand, Crysis Wars is an update to original multiplayer mode. It's fun, vast and deep experience, that can wipe Battlefield's ♥♥♥ with Maximum Power. The Wars half of that pack was the sole reason I purchased this pack. And you know what? ♥♥♥♥ Gamespy, ♥♥♥♥ EA, they discontinued so many games, that I don't want to ever buy anything from them. So here we are. We have halfassed mod, that cannot compare to original in its wildest dream, and butchered multiplayer game, which does not work out of the box, and needs community patch to run on community servers. On top of that, game does not run well on modern PCs, because for some reason steam does not download x64 binnaries, you need to google them. Is that worth any money? No. Do I recommend to purchase this pack here on steam? No. Do I recommend purchasing anything that has EA on it? You've guessed it.",-1,1
17410,Mirror's Edge,"A recommended game, it seems you are doing parkour because it is in first person and that is quite innovative and attractive. The worst part of the game is its story, very simple. It gives the feeling that the only thing you do is jump and run because yes",1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"This game is one of the best and most unique games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It still holds up today as a great game.   The gameplay is a first person parkour game at heart with moments of FPS in the later chapters (though they are not required). The game gives you a tutorial level to get used to all the different controls though once you learn them, playing the game is not difficult because of controls. Though not open world, the chapters are large areas that provide more than one way to progress, which can certaintly help in the time trials. In my personal opinion, the keyboard controls are clunky and using a controller is far superior. One downside is that this is a game that could potentially give you motion sickness, while I am fine playing this game, others have been unable to play this due the motion sickness.  The visuals are beautiful, providing a minimalist view of the city that uses shades of white and grey mixed with some colour to create vibrant scenery that doesn't distract from the gameplay. The red colour ties in with Runner Vision, showing you the best routes or what you can interact with (this can be turned off).  The music in this game is outstanding and numbers amongst my all time favourites. Solar Fields did a great job in creating music for this game as it adds to the atmosphere of the game and the tension and action at the right moments.   The story is the weak part of this game but it's not terrible. It's a basic plot of Faith, the main character, trying to save her sister, Kate, after she is set up for a murder. Sprinkled in is the corruption and survelliance of the city and it's officials to create a dystopian type of city that is presented as a utopia to the masses. The characters are intresting enough to care about and help to save the story. You'll meet a bunch of characters throughout, friends, foes, or something in between. The cutscenes are surprisingly 2D animated ones that give a comic book feel to them.  Overall this is still a great game, you should definetely give it a go. It's worth it at full price and if you're still not sure the game goes on sale often. In comparison to the new one Catalyst, this is the better game though Catalyst itself is still quite a good one it had some differences from this.",1,0

It's a severely underrated parkour game that uses simple color schemes and fun gameplay mechanics to give an experience that's all it's own.

17410,Mirror's Edge,"Just finished this game's story mode. Got it on sale for £2. All things considered, it felt like a bargain.  I loved the aesthetics and when you knew where you were going whilst freerunning it felt really energetic and exciting. Sometimes though, when you tried to jump to a ledge that you could easily make, you'd just plummet to your death (those situations are a mix of it being your fault even if you don't want to admit it and the parkour mechanics falling short). Sometimes it was hard to find where you're supposed to go next as well. This isn't so bad if you're in an area with no enemies and can actually be kind of fun, but you'll end up in really fast-paced situations not knowing where to go, so you have to slow right down which kind of kills the adrenaline rush you get from lightning fast parkour.  I found the story to be a bit lackluster as well. It sounds good on paper, where it's implied that the city the game takes place in is basically NSAland, but the story within the world of Mirror's Edge that focuses on Faith and those she encounters wasn't very engaging. I didn't feel any real connection to any of the characters. I won't describe what happens because nobody likes spoilers, but there are twists and events that happen that you can call very early on.  Also you'll end up in situations where you have to do the exact opposite of what the game tells you to do, which is to avoid combat with large groups of enemies. Occasionally you'll have absolutely no choice but to use the horrible gun mechanics to kill literally everyone before you can move on.  Still, I don't want to sound like I'm too harsh on it. It was an experimental IP that came out almost 8 years ago which succeeded in some areas and less so in others. Overall it's a fun game when the mechanics work properly with attractive level design and an addictive soundtrack (the main menu music is beautifully done) but I would've been disappointed if I paid the full retail price for it.",1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"First of all, don't be fooled, even if it says that i only played 0.2 hours, it's not true. i can't use the steam client all the time, so i play offline, i actually played 2 hours and a half, give or take.   Anyway, like most of other reviewers, i have to select NO, unfortunately, this game is a 'yes, but..' kind of game. Don't get me wrong, the game looks stunning but it's basically 'portal meets super mario'. you are thrown into a level and you have to get to the other side by jumping and running on walls, but if you die (and you WILL die, more on that later) you'll respawn in a fixated spawn point (just like portal) the problem that this spawn point can be anywhere from a few feet away to three rooftops away, this will force you to re-jump previously jumped obstacles, re-punch enemies and re-listen to any conversation that might have happened (i swear to God, if i have to hear that 'the cops are closing in' one more time i'm going to kill someone). now, about the dieing part, everything wants you dead and will shoot you on sight. there is no stealth option, no way to defend yourself besides the stupidly weak melee attack (i know, you can disarm cops but first you must get IN RANGE and wait for the gun to get flashy and even if you do that, you'll have only a couple of shots) and if you are even slightly misalligned you'll end up doing the wrong kind of jump, plummeting to your doom...and respawning...and hearing those same lines over and over and over again.  the story for what i could grasp between the bullets, it's the classic distopian future with evil corporates that want to silence the good people (feel free to correct me on this one) but, again, it's hard to focus on the story when you are shot by literally the entire police force! and, apparently, there are subquests you should complete (picking up bags, i think) but i was only able to find 3 of them (again, hard to explore when trying to avoid bullets). i'm really disappointed, it's the first time i actually asked for a refund  so, to recap: +good visuals +interesting setup  +(probably) good story  -anti-immersive game mechanics -you'll burn more miles in half an hour of this game than Shaggy and Scooby did in the whole Scooby-Doo universe -necessity to explore but inability to do so -annoying navi-like navigator (i know there are cops here, THEY ARE SHOOTING ME!)",-1,1
17410,Mirror's Edge,"I was very dissapointed with this game.  You expect smooth parkour run with variety of paths to choose? No way. You have to learn were to go, where are the guards and how to get rid of them. Die like 100 times doing this in one sequence. After that MAYBE you will do it smooth in one take.

17410,Mirror's Edge,"So I'm 7 years late to this game which may affect this review...  My overall opinion is the game was pretty bland. Visually it was really cool but I felt the level design was not great. It was not fun to have to retry a section over again because you couldn't see the right ledge or platfrom to go on. The enemies we also pretty bland and the combat system was a joke. There are couple of occasions when the game does sing with the parkour, but there are just a few.   Again maybe 7 years ago this was the rage, but I'm not really seeing why.",-1,0

17470,Dead Space,"I've always heard great things about this game, and the hype is right! I've finished the game and can barely wait to start the sequel!  It's an over-the-shoulder shooter (much like Resident Evil or Mass Effect), and the immersion is incredible. There's no HUD blocking the screen, ammo displays are on weapons and your health is displayed on the back of your character's suit. All the in-game menus (Maps, Inventory, Journal, etc) as well as video and audio communication are displayed with holographic projections from your suit. The game also has areas of zero-gravity where you must navigate your way by flying across the rooms, and hopefully not plunge into deep space.  The player takes the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer and space ship systems specialist sent as part of a repair mission to the USG Ishimura, a large scale mining vessel. Upon arrival you quickly realize that disaster has struck the Ishimura and spend the game trying to get out alive. Throughout the game you can upgrade the space hazmat suit you wear, as well as buy and upgrade various weapons. The majority of the weapons you acquire are improvised tools, such as plasma cutters and buzz saws, reflecting that you're primarily an engineer, and not a soldier.  All in all it's a great buy; solid gameplay, a gripping story, and an incredible soundtrack. I highly recommend it.",1,0

The biggest problem i have with this game is they stopped making them after the4th game.  If you love turn based rpg's get this game If you love witty humor and a corky story get this game.

1840,Source Filmmaker,"Source FIlmmaker is a soup maker developed by Carrot Corp inc. in 1412 as a responce to prime competitior Apull inc.'s Cabbage encyclopedia released a year before in 1413. Sauce IceCreammaker is a tool which allows many gamers to step into the world of stop-motion clay animation, thanks to its impossible to use user interface and its use of the unreal 6 engine. Many gamers however were disapointed that no features broke upon using the power tool, and that it only took 3 minutes to learn how to use the cooking utensil. Because of this, IGN rated this game 'Best Vinyl Record of the Year' in 0213, stating: 'The developers clearly don't understand that the T-Rex is 10 million years closer to us than they were to the Stegosaurus.

Since you're a loser that does what anyone tells you for raw diamonds, you proceede to help two factions fighting eachother, and kill numerous African people made out of kevlar(pick a white character for extreme butthurt). You collect weapons at an alarming rate while commiting assassinations, and do not once question if you have a problem. Every know and then you look for a 'trusty doctor' who you save in trade for a unlabled bottle of 'malaria medication(maybe this is all a big drug trip).

19900,Far Cry 2,"This game was aiming for a lot of things, neither fun nor realism is one of those, instead, frustration is the main thing developers have in mind: Enemy outposts all over the map, will infinitely respawn, will pursuit non-stop on approach and outspeed/outram you every time (if you are lucky enough to not die by jeep mounted machinegun by then), will aim for your precise location if facing your general direction when alerted regardless how far you are, meanwhile they are concealed behind foliage and body armor that takes half a magazine of AK to bring down  There are only 2 kinds objectives in this game: kill this person or blow up that asset(which is an exaggeration and you do get a barge protection mission on river that has enemies raining bullets and mortars all over the place while you keep yourself alive without cover and repair the turtle speed barge everytime mortar hits it) Occationally you get to deliver passports as errands, but of course before you can do that, you need to clear the destination surrounded by a bunch of hostile enemies everytime.  Killing a target is fine by itself since the game gives you enough tactical options to make it not repetitive or even fun sometimes, however after you throw in the omipresent and omiscient enemies that drains your health along way(by the way, 90% of the game you will be driving or dealing with pursuing enemies along the way, navigating with physical maps that block your vision in cars), things can get really annoying. And that's not all, you have weapon jamming needing replacement every 10 minutes of use, quadbike breaking down every 5 minutes of normal offroading usage/jeeps breaking down after 2 minute chase, chronic malaria that forces you to do driving delivery missions and dealing with pursuing enemies by extension.  The game pretends to have choices of choosing factions to work for, baddies you kill, or buddies to help you in the field, in the end, you experience the exact same thing, you don't have choices or choices don't matter at all.  This is a game that frustrates non-stop even with trainers/cheats on, tuned down enemy mod can fix it to a certain extent, but even with all the remedies for bad gameplay, the faded brown filter and low quality grass doesn't do the game any favour either, not worth experiencing except the setting and plot",-1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.",1,0

10130,TimeShift,"I am voting Yes, but there are several things I am not at all pleased with.  Firstly, I found no direct controller support, and the functions of the time control on the KB are not fun to use.  There were some issues getting the game to launch, but I reinstalled it later and it worked after ignoring the 'Incompatible Drivers' warning.  That being said, the game is not that bad. If you liked Half Life, the original Red Faction, Time Splitters, and other games like these, you will probably enjoy TimeShift. It really isn't bad.  People may complain about it being dated graphics or design... and? It is an older game, but it is a decent older game, IF YOU LIKED HALF LIFE.  If you see it on sale and want a game that feels like most PS2, GameCube, XBOX era FPS shooters, this looks a bit nicer, and feels really similar. It is a good fit, just wish I could use a controller for time controlling :/",1,0
10130,TimeShift,"Played the beta of this one, was hyped and cool. Recently bought the full game, spent 2 days on it, we-e-e-ell... No. No is a perfect word.  Time powers? No. Game adjusts timers and cooldowns as creators had planned ahead of you. 'Okay, man, scripted parts are okay, but otherwise you can do what you want!' - again no, your 'mana' meter won't allow you to. It won't be time-travelling kung fu out there, but just spamming Time Stop once in 7 seconds to insta-regen health and continue dodging tons of bullets.  Cool fighting? No. Grab the most overpowered guns in game and hope nobody shpongles charged plasma in your backside.  Cool graphics? Oh well, 2.5 out of 5. Backgrounds and levels are nice and linear, NPC are ugly, and you never see yourself in game. Even hands.  Cool storyline? Err... well, they explained basically nothing. HInts don't tie up into solid story, and there wasn't a solid story to begin with. Even motives and build-up are missing.  Cool multiplayer? Go get Unreal Tournament and forget this, srsly.  Cool cinematics? Yes, 5 seconds each. But hey! - we'll get a nude female once in a while there! Worth it!  My verdict - complete waste of time on our side and questionable waste of money and resources on developer's side. gg 2 ez.",-1,1
10150,Prototype,"DESTRUCTION N' CHAOS :) Also acceptable story, keeps you motivated to destroy even more.",1,1
10150,Prototype,"IMPORTANT NOTE: NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU HAVE WIN 8 OR WIN 10. There are problems and this game is old.  Recommended if you can solve audio issue and if you are comfortable with playing at max 1280x720 resolution.  This game was awesome back when it was released. Prototype is an openworld game. You are mutated into some kind of super immortal mutant. There is a nice story of how got mutated and what happens to you thoughout the game.  Tha game mechanincs are fluid as it should be in this kind of free roaming game. Moving and running through buildings and crowd does not require much effort cuz you are a super mutant. But combat has a lot of variety.  The best thing about this game is you are a multifunctional mutant and have a hammerfist or a blade arm or tendrils or claws. the game utilises all of these mutant properties in combat. And this brings confusing key combinations. but once you get the general idea, combat becomes incredibly fun.  There are tanks and helicopters to hijack and drive or fly. Many side activities and challenges to spend time and collectibles that completes the background of the story accross the map. Even after completing the game, you might wander around destroying military or infected buildings or just creating massive chaos for fun.  Visuals are state of the art back in the day it was developed. The map of the game is big enough i guess. Not like Farcry or Tomb raider but big.  I am having audio and resolution bugs but if you can solve these issues, this game is so fun and playable.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"Looking at this game, you're probably wondering...'Should I buy [Prototype]?'. It depends. Prototype is a basically the definition of a murder simulator. All you do in this game is kill and attempt to hide.  The AI is crap, the locations are meh, you see the same civilian about a billion times in the same area you are in, the missions have barely any variety (other than kill more people and run up a building) and Alex Mercer is so emo its not even funny.   So should you get this game? The only thing [Prototype] has that GTA, Saint's Row, and Just Cause don't have is extreme gore and constant killing in grotesque ways. If you want something with a bit more depth than that, I would advise you to look somewhere else. Otherwise, welcome to New York, Mr. Mercer.  Verdict: PASS",-1,0

Sure, the second one has more stuff, a more interesting upgrade system, 2 player co-op and is overall the better game but the first one is still fun.  It has a better feel to kill orcs than Unchained and the progression pacing is more fluid. Maybe not worth the 10 bucks anymore as OMD2 is out for years but owning OMD1 gets you 10 extra levels in OMD2 so alone for this it's worth at least the sale price.",1,0

104100,Inside a Star-filled Sky,"This is the soul of video games right here: one man doing all the artwork, music, and programming for a game. It's how the industry began! The result in this case is something more unique than most corporate-funded teams would ever think of, much less dare to release.  Ever seen the movie 'Existenz'? Don't. It's silly. See 'The Thirteenth Floor' instead. It's way better. Anyway, both movies tackle the idea of recursive realities. Inside a Star-Filled Sky puts CONTROL of that concept at the core of a gaming experience. That enemy's too tough? Enter him, dumb-down his abilities, exit, then waste him with ease. Alternatively, enter yourself, learn Kung Fu, exit, then waste him with ease.  Jason Rohrer has made a game that's thought-provoking, moderately mind-bending ('What was I trying to do again? And which level of reality IS this?!'), a good bit of pixelphilic fun, and simply worth your money. If nothing else, I admire his proper use of hyphenation. Support literate games!",1,0

The developers have moved onto their new game (planetary annihlation), but I hope they consider a sequel because this was a lot of fun for the games I played.   I recommend only because I think the game is awesome, but should you download it? well the matchmaking system doesnt work well anymore with a low population, and you can only get quick games by making custom games and inviting people from lobby individually.

105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,"Ok. So the English voice acting...was...at times...truly terrible. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this game - proper voice acting would have made it so many times better. There are occasionally random sentences in German that apparentally didn't get replaced with English, the sound mixing can be uneven, and the acting stilted. Be that as it may - I felt like the acting at least got progressively better over the course of the game - or maybe I just became more accustomed to them..  HOWEVER, I truly became very immersed and invested in the story of the game by the halfway point or so. In the end, this is one of my favorite point-and-click adventures that I have played within the last year.",1,0

105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,"Hello earthlings. We love video...games and we know you....would love this one.  Now this may in fact be due to the translation, but this is stilted and unnatural writing and voice acting even for a robot. And not only is the message preachy but also misguided at best or horribly intellectually dishonest at worst. The game starts off with you repairing a machine who's sole purpose is to kill all of the wild life in the forest in order to keep the wood fresh, whatever that means. So I don’t know about you, but I use a wood burning furnace to heat my home during the winter and I don’t poison all living creatures in order to keep the wood fresh. No what you do is chop a tree down (normally a dead one or one that needs to be moved) and then you split and stack it and depending on the wood you have leave It for a year to be burned later. I’m sorry I just lied to you because in order to burn wood you must use a poison gas emitter in order to kill (as the game shows) or smoke out (how this would work if you’re ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to actually do this) all living things, because when you run out of wood to burn you need to chop down the next tree, one at a time, in ten below weather and in the middle of a snow storm. This is in the first few minutes of game play and it doesn’t get better. This isn’t even preaching, this is as if an alien traveled to earth and decided to make videogame who just choose to make a game based off a popular topic and he is painfully unaware that everyone can tell he is not human.",-1,0

105600,Terraria,I have played this game since before The Wall Of Flesh was a thing. I have seen this game evolve into something amazing. The game play is a lot more burgeoning and less survival. There are boss fights and much more! I have well over 500 hours put into this game. It was worth the money. I recommend this game to anyone who likes survivals. I also recommend this over Minecraft in a heartbeat.  9/10,1,0
105600,Terraria,"I have the most hours of any steam game on this game, over 450, and there is still lots to do and build! I still have many progects that are unfinished, so there is tons to do in terraria! Its very fun to try and collect certian things (ex: dev sets) and expert mode is very challenging to try and beat. Multiplayer is fun too, but I like to have only 2 players, or sharing loot gets kinda annoying. overall, great game, and still trying to get that last achevement...",1,0

105600,Terraria,"This game is AMAZING!!! Do not let anyone tell it is a '2-D Minecraft.' It is so much more than that. You have way more weapons, more enemies, and you have bosses that make the game fun and challenging! Unlike Minecraft which is fun for a bit until you just keep doing the samething over and over agian. This game has variety, and creativity, which makes it entertaining everytime you play it. Buy this game now! Because you are missing out if you don't have it.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"10/10 : Amazing game  If you generaly enjoy the mechanics of 2-D side scrollers, you will absolutely love terraria.  The game allows you to beat various bosses, gather items for stronger equipment and just genreally progress the game at your own pace.  If you do find the game fun, you will find yourself spending many hours on it and enjoying every second :D",1,0

105600,Terraria,"well I'd say its nice its polished but it lacks, lackes something intristing and what that is, it is that the begining is slo but the end game items are worth it but you have to have 1 of 2 things. one is patiants the other is have freinds that give you items in end game. these a third one wich is cheating mods well any way its fun buy it if interested but no patiants is key",1,1

105600,Terraria,"I don't think you understand how good this game is. I started off not knowing how to talk to the Guide. I got angry and gave up. I tried one more time a week later. I currently own this game for 4 systems and bought it for 4 people. I made my original world into one giant house filled with portals. I am an addict. Should you get this game? No. Get a life. Don't do this to yourself.  No, I don't mean it. Get it and come play with me. In my super house. Get lost with me. Never see the light of day again. Do it. Please.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"If you enjoy a game that has open-ended building, a focus on adventure, hundreds of unique and interesting items to loot, and then lots of scary monsters to throw stuff at and cast cool magic spells at, then I guess you might enjoy this game okay.  It's not minecraft though. Don't pretend it's like minecraft.",1,1
105600,Terraria,Super addicting and rewarding. Endless replayability and devs that just can't seem to stop adding free additional content!  best game purchase I've made in a while!,1,0

105600,Terraria,"Well, after Steam not saving my first review, I'll paraphrase. The game is a diverse, surreal, and unique game, despite preposterous acusations of being a Minecraft clone. This game gets a 5/5 from me and a Steam Award nomination.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I had nearly 100 hours of fun with this game. It has everything: Building, fighting, surviving and boss fights. I think it´s not half the fun alone, but with 1-2 friends it´s great! So much possibilities and constant new free updates. Love it!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"-Friends tell me its a minecraft clone -watch some youtube videos and determine they are wrong -buy it because it looks cool -way better than minecraft, literally 50x the content -games focus is on combat but even building is stellar  buy it its much more fun with friends  10/10",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I've logged over 200 hours of this game now, one of my single most played games on Steam, and all I have to say is that if you don't already own Terraria you're missing out on one of the best games ever made. There are plenty of clones out there nowadays but none of them can capture the majesty of slaughtering blood-crazed unicorns by raining down red hot lazer death as you soar through the heavens with devil wings.   Watch out for sky dragons.",1,1
105600,Terraria,Yes. No.,1,1
105600,Terraria,"With out a doubt one of the top No:5 best games of all time.  if you dont have it... buy it. if you own it, but don't like it... your not playing it right. look up some guides.  no point in saying more, 1000s of other players already have.  Price is too low.  you could play for 100 hours and still not complete it.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"You're probably here to look for the counter-arguments against Terraria, but is frustrated to find only dumb or fake reviews telling you 'just buy it/what are you doing viewing negative for terrria lmao lol kk'. Well, I'm here to tell the truth, and while there aren't many cons to terraria, the three main things you need to take into consideration:   - Dies out kinda fast when playing alone. A lot of the replayability comes from the fun of playing with another person, trying community maps, etc. May not apply to everyone, but applies to me and my friends so I would take that into consideration if you intend to only play Singleplayer.  - Poor compatibility with new OS versions, frequent break reports every time a new OS version is released.  - Requires guiding from the internet or another player because just like Minecraft or Garry's Mod, it has no intent in helping you whatsoever. May not be a negative if you like that kind of stuff, but it does require commitment and some people don't like it so it's good to take that into consideration.  Just taking this out of my stomach. This is not a negative review per se, I still think Terraria is an amazing game despite these three flaws (look at my playtime!), but this ♥♥♥♥ is seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.",-1,1

105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a feature-rich 2D Action-RPG with an incredible amount of depth, and I don’t just mean vertically. Many people like to compare this game to Minecraft, but I feel that this is an incorrect analogy. Terraria very heavily encourages combat, fighting bosses, exploring, and “leveling-up” (done in the form of collecting heart crystals and stars to increase health and mana). There is a metric-ton of things to do, items to craft, etc. in this game. In fact, there is so much stuff that ironically you wind up wondering what to do. Terraria’s greatest weakness is too much content and not enough direction. If you plan to play this game, you should just go ahead and bookmark the wiki, because you’re going to be going there every five-fifteen minutes trying to figure out where to get this component or why this summoning item doesn’t work. But don’t let this discourage you. If you put in the initial time, you will get an incredible amount out of it, especially since its always going on sale for $2.49. It seemed for me that my enjoyment of the game would come in stages. Sometimes I would wake up and all I would want to play was Terraria. Other times, I could let it sit for days without so much as looking at it.  The start is slow, progression sometimes confusing, but ultimately this game is just incredibly fun. If you are interested in this game, I would definitely recommend it, especially if it is on sale.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game is filled with endless adventure! Tons of fun, very much recommended. It makes it much more fun with friends.",1,0
105600,Terraria,Imagine Minecraft mixed with a Metroidvania style game.,1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria many say that it's a rip- off of Minecraft, but in my opinon it's very different (with simlarites), This game gaveme so much adventure and expert mode extended my gaming insticts to another level of fun, exitement and difficulty. This game is highly rated but who can blame them? THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!! Now there is a down side, the music was Ok-Great the animation was mostly good and this game has lot of 'back-bone' when it comes to adventure. So I say this will keep you entertained for hours SO IT DESERVES!  4.5 stars :)",1,0

105600,Terraria,"So someone gifts me this game. Ok, I guess I'll give it a try.  I launch the game, start game, etc etc, and here I am sitting atop a 2D world of procedurally generated terrain. There's no instructions on how to do anything, so I'm stuck with an empty inventory, a giant world, and a companion that doesn't seem to be able to do anything.  In short, there was no tutorial or objective given, so apparently I was just supposed to run around and dig holes or something.  It's not that I don't understand the sandbox part of the game, since I have gmod and I understand making cool stuff on your own... but this game... this game is directionless.",-1,1
105600,Terraria,it is prity good,-1,1
105600,Terraria,"To all the Game Developers who are making Terraria, I'd like to give my Honest opinion to this Horrible Game. Kudos to the Character Customisation, a 1/10 for my liking, however, I was playing with my Loving and Kind friends until I died every 5 seconds by Trees, Dogs and even Parrots. This Game is a Disgrace to Steam and should be Banned. Don't let this Minecraft-Copied game enter your lives, It will create Havoc to your Wonderful Lives. Definitely not worth paying $10 for.",-1,1
105600,Terraria,0/10 can't sit on chairs.,-1,1
105600,Terraria,"I recommend this game because it is very addicting but it can be hard to defeat the wall of flesh. The wall of flesh drops tons of loot including the pwnhammer and hardmode. The pwnhammer is a hammer that breaks alters. Hard mode unlocks the other have of the game that isn't accesable until you destroy wall of flesh. I still have not defeated him even after 75+ hours of game time. I even played 13 hours in a row once and still got nowhere. Maybe it rely's on the fact that im only 11 years old. To defeat the wall of flesh, I suggest using a star cannon, minishark, demon sythe, water bolt, any type of staff EX: diamond staff, ruby staff. One weapon I use a lot is the space gun. I made myself molten armor but I never use it because with my meteorite armor, I don't use up mana with my space gun. Anyways, I really recommend this game especially if you like very addicing, challenging, and adventurous games.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"A sidescrolling craft-'em-up where you can explore, create and fight alone or with friends. Offers more diversity gameplay-wise than spiritual predecessor Minecraft, so if the genre is your cup of tea, you can find hours upon hours of game time for a really reasonable price. It is important to note, however, that the lack of narrative in this game makes for a create-your-own-goals kind of experience.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game is filled with thousands of great activities to do. One of my friends had it on his phone and showed me it... after ten minutes i knew i had to have it. Soon i bought the game and just played.  I started in the woods with only one friend... the guide. Soon i was fighting every boss in the game with my amazing equipment. This game has literally almost everything you can think of. You can mine, have a garden, build, cut trees, destroy monsters, and blowup the face of your enemies  I highly recommend this game in EVERY WAY. Please try out the game you WON'T regret it.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria  Eater of Lives  This game lets you ride unicorns as a werewolf shooting rainbows at pixies. It lets you build giant, amazing structures while still keeping to a 2D space. It lets you fight many many many bosses, each with their own unique drops. This game doens't have something it can't do!  Oh wait. There is something it can't do. Be beaten by Minecraft.  ;)   *Please don't call Terraria a Minecraft rip-off. Because it isn't*",1,0

105600,Terraria,"This game...  This game has a way of sucking out your soul. Decided to give it a whirl after several friends insisted I give it a play. I am a huge fan of Minecraft and other large Sandbox games. Initially, I sneered at the graphics and thought to myself 'how much detail could this game possibly have?'  Boy, was I wrong. Between the vast biomes, wide array of mobs, large collection of craftable items, and random events that occur, you will find yourself quite buy.  First Blood Moon, I was ripping my hair out, trying to keep the invasion of monsters out of myself. It was comical and caught me off guard. If you enjoy Minecraft, you may be pleasantly surprised like I was at how much more combat based Terraria is. There is certainly plenty of places to explore, mine, and build. But you will find yourself fending off random mobs much more often.  I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Sandbox games.",1,0

It's practically Minecraft, except a 2D side scroller version, and with a WHOOOOLE load more things to do. You start off with nothing, having to mine, and to survive the night, and then a good fifty hours later, you, wielding fire swords, or even magic, are trying to survive the invasion and onslaught of dragons, unicorns, gods and even aliens.

105600,Terraria,"This Game is amazing, the best 2-D platformer I've ever played. Ever since the update, I've been lost but the new enemies, items, bioms, weapons and tools provide an astounding challenge, 20 out of 5. 400%  People usually compare Terraria to minecraft, in my opinion they should be slapped. Sure, the main block shape is the same. A cube/square, but the content of this game has so much more to offer, furthermore minecraft has no goal, except to defeat two bosses, TWO. But, in Terraria there are multiple bosses for you to set a goal to slay, not to mention, server creation is much, much easier.   My total score on a 1-10 scale between them is Terraria:7 Minecraft:3",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game is so much more than it meets the eye.  The first time I saw this game on the internet I didn't want to believe that this is actually good. Well after a while I decided to buy it and try it out well there is nothing much to lose and price is okay. I was blown away by all the things I could do in Terraria, it's astonishing. I am a huge fan of the games where you actually have to put some effort in it.  Gameplay: In order to make things and advance in the game you need to gather resources. With a newly acquired items and equipment you can gather resources you couldn't before and so on. By doing all these things you encounter many enemies and discover many interesting places in a vast Terraria world. Even when you think that you done it all, believe me there is still a lot of fun things to do.  Also I got to say that game developers are making such a huge effort in game updates. Every update is really huge and gives us so many good new stuff so Terraria never gets boring.  Also for the final words I should just say: BUY IT and have a GREAT TIME.",1,0

Here is why I recommend it: Terraria feels like a true rpg, full of exploration and things to do. Hundreds of things to craft and sell... maybe thousands! Bosses to fight, quest to complete, monsters to kill, people to find, new places and biomes to explore, and many more. I give this game a solid 9.9/10, very fun game! Better than Minecraft impo!",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I would definetely recomend this game to anyone who has ten bucks laying around. It's an excellent sandbox game and has good replay value. First the character customization. This is a very cool part of the game, and has many options to chose from. You can choose the basics of your character, then later in the game get different vanity items. (My favorite being the Doctor's clothes.) I think this feature adds character to the game. It is also good as a sandbox, or for just building stuff. I think that they emphasized the building part a bit too much. You can tell that this game was meant to be an adventure game, and I think that the developers didn't need to add in all of thse extra decoration blocks. Again, that is just my opinion. This game starts a bit slow, when you still have the basic weapons and tools, but it gets really fun later. All in all, I think that this is a very good game. 7/10",1,0

(or Pot if you're a hippy or played the Epic Battle Fantasy Series)√ 7: Get killed by mobs 8: Have fun and have a party. Pros: enjoyable game to play, Almost no Limits due to wild imagination, and can build a Mineshaft or rollercoster (maybe) easily (once you have the Materials to build one of them).

105600,Terraria,"Terraria is loved by many, but I don't know why. It's less user friendly than Dwarf Fortress.  The game is tight lipped about its basic controls, and this is something that you just can't afford unless the controls are very simple and very intuitive. They aren't.  For some utterly bizarre reason, the default settings don't pause the game when you open the main menu, so you have no respite from the enemies who WILL rip you to shreds even while you are trying to learn what button or mouse click you use to swing your sword and defend yourself from them. But the menu and its confusing submenus don't even offer that information. There might be a key binding submenu somewhere; I wouldn't know, I never found it.  I could find a few wikis with a Google search, but none of them mentioned basic controls either.  I managed to fumble my way blindly through the first elements of combat and building... and then I made a mistake, as one is wont to do when fumbling around blindly. I built a wall around my character from which she could not escape. Now I needed to know how to unbuild something. One would think that in a building game, this would be an essential tool to anyone, one the designers would want to be sure you understood from the beginning. But there was no help for me that I could find either in-game or in an online community.  My only recourse was to blindly click and swing everything, flinging my weapons gaily away while zombies chewed on my unguarded toes and a block in front of my forehead prevented me from moving.  It turns out that the solution was that I had to use a specific item, the pickaxe, on any block or item I wanted to unbuild. I discovered this after about 13 minutes of frustrated, blind experimentation.  The devs claim that this game is not a Minecraft clone, but I refute them. How in the blazing hells do you expect anyone who isn't a Minecraft player to intuitively understand that in order to unbuild things you need to hit them with a pickaxe? At least in Minecraft you CAN remove things without a specific tool, it's merely less efficient. Here, no such luck.  Tutorials don't need to be explicit or in your face, but if your controls are complex, or gods help you unintuitive, they MUST be present. Terraria and all its wikis completely fail to give a damn about introducing you to them. I have met seasoned players who can't answer me when I ask them how to control whether a placed chair faces right or left.  It doesn't deserve its legacy. Play Dwarf Fortress instead. It's not simple either, but a Google search and a few clicks can get you a user-friendly tutorial. It's the father of games like Terraria and Minecraft, and can compete with them in potential for building awesome things. It has a huge dedicated user-base, tons of assisting tools, a well-maintained wiki of virtually any information you could want, and it's completely free, funded by donations alone.",-1,0

Pros: -literally everything  -dedicated and supportive devs WHO LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY -graphics are both unique and lovable -updates out the wazoo -multiplayer fun -great price -unlimited replayability  Cons: - Honestly one of the few games I can't find a con for",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game is great, all the exploring to find that one pyramid, or that floating island, its great .defeating the bosses for the first time is epic, intense, fun, and rewarding. All the magical items there are, its just so much fun, the Cloud in a bottle, you double jump, sandstorm in a bottle, you fly for some seconds and there are so many, and when you find a cool one its awesome, the variation of weapons is increadible, for example you dont like the bow?. there s a goddamm book that shots magic water, you have a sword that deals 40 damage, you have a sword that deals 38, with the first one you kill zombies in 1 hit, and the second one in 2, but it attacks super fast, and its large. there are not just magic books, swords and bows, there is a magic staff, guns, (im speak spanish so i dont know this word) and a ball with a chain attached to it, and i think im missing a few weps, but there is so many variation aon the swords, bows etc. that you always want something  Lets get to the bad stuff: Its anoying when you try to find a thing in your world, and you try so hard, but at the end, you realize that that doesnt exist in your world, so you need to make a new world hoping that that thing is in there, it sucks on ice. it gives you no explenation, so you better find someone in YouTube playing it.  i give it a 9/10",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Saying Terraria is a rip-off of Minecraft is like saying Battlefield is a rip-off of COD. They are two VASTLY different games with extremely different content and gameplay.

There ARE mods and servers in Terraria, do not say there are not, Terraria has about 100-150 (this is a estimate) accesories, Minecraft has 0, so please just stop.

105600,Terraria,"I highly recommend this game. The exploration is fun and there is plenty of room in the game for hours upon hours of fun. The only real cons I see in the game is that the building is kinda difficult, the inventory always fills up because you auto pickup EVERYTHING loose on the ground, and along with that, I wish the inventory was just unlimited anyways, but maybe that would make the game too easy. In any case, this game is well worth it!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Well let's get started! So you start off with a wee-tiny copper shortsword, a nice axe, and a nice pickaxe. You kill some slime, break some trees, and mine some stone until you've got a house with a nice crafting table and furnace. Neat! Now let's go mining again, get the iron you missed, few hints of silver, gold, ruby, topaz, emerald, cool! In that time you've upgraded your house, killed a few zombies, and made some houses for the npcs to live in. You currently have the guide and the merchant living in those houses, and you decide to adventure to the dangerous corrupt! *dun dun dun* You then find some shadow orbs and break them until BANG! The Eater of Worlds is coming to... well... eat you! You manage to slay it with that nice silver gear you have, and go to the wiki. You realize that you can fight the eye/brain of Cthulu at that point and do so. You make demonite gear with the drops of those bosses and take on Skeletron at the dungeon. After that you explore the said dungeon and find some loot! You fight a few extra bosses like the infamous Queen Bee and make your way to hell. After a perilous fight with the Wall of Flesh, your world is now in hard mode! I won't spoil the whole hard mode thing because that would take me 80 pages, but you dig, fight, and build. Yep. Coulda' just said that from the beginning... Cool.",1,0

I must say this is a really different experience than the other versions of it (Android, iOS, etc.) where Terraria is quite easy when this version is really a game changer, thus making it challenging if you stayed put with the other versions of it, like i did. It may take time to get into the controls of the game but once you master it the gameplay can be so ADDICTING!  Overall this is a worthy game to buy and play everyday!",1,1

105600,Terraria,"I edited my review on this game because it's just too good. Also because I was young and needed a lot more than filling a review with pointless memes that are not funny in the entirety of it.  Terraria has gone through multiple changes, anything it could possibly think of at the tips of your fingers. It's my most favorite 'copy of Minecraft' ever (my second favorite being Unturned). Of course people complain about it being a flat world, but it really puts a challenge on building and everything. Create houses for NPCs, storage, the dozens of crafters to build, grind for wood, summon bosses, and all to defeat one man--- THE MOON LORD.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I have over 1,000 hours on this game and have had it for almost 3 years. It never gets old. With all the new content they release for FREE, there is no way you can get tired of it.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Man, when this game has more hours combined than all of my other games, it's great. (Maybe even World of Warcraft.)  First off, there is so much to explore in the beginning, you have a multitude of directions you can go, left, right, down, or up, if you're adventurous. You can find chests full of awesome loot, two evil hell on earth biomes, and other awesome things just on the surface.  Now, underground is where you're going to be spending most of your time. (Looking for loot, at least.) There is many awesome diverse structures and little mini biomes to be discovered underground, the surface biomes even have their own underground counterparts! (My favorite is the jungle...)  The amount of loot in this game is absolutely amazing, it's almost breathtaking the amount of weapons and tools you can find. You start off with cheap ore swords, then you progress to looted swords you can find, then you begin making those awesome legendary swords such as the Night's Edge. It's awesome how pumped full of loot this game is.  In conclusion, this is one of the most addicting, time-killing games you can pick up for only five flippin' bucks. Five bucks. It's packed full of content, amazing bosses, beautiful landscapes and adventures to be had.  Also, don't compare this to Minecraft as they are two completely different games, this is a more of a fantasy RPG style game, while Minecraft is more realistic and survival-based.",1,0

Now some pros and cons Pros: -lots of hot girls -tons of master bait -great bosses -witchcraft -worms -pets that can kill you -cheating in red potions just to kill yourself. -soundtrack is neat Cons: -the golem is so damn hard -no portal gun being shot at the moon jokes -throwing class is useless in hard mode :( -no hamdraxes ---- This review is more a joke 11/10 game needs more portal shot at moon jokes",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Now if I could have figured that I would have ended up with 2400 hours (At the time of the review) in this game when I first got it, I would have called you crazy. Well, atleast until 1.2 came out (Which was a week or so after I bought it). When I first started playing, I'll be honest and say that I knew how a few things worked going in, knew that I needed to make a house, knew I needed to fight 3 bosses.   Lucky to say that within that week, I was thrown out on my ♥♥♥ from that bit I knew and was better off for it. 1.2 and onward made for some of the most fun I've ever had in a game, and I got to discover new stuff all over the place.   Nowadays we're post-Red and while I don't agree with some of the practices (Would have rather had 1 or 2 updates instead of 4, would have made the updates more exciting) and while looking at two sequels , I'd honestly say that I'd be satisfied with the game as it is now.   But then they keep updating, and if theres one thing better than something being great, it's being great and getting better.  Let's hope the future for this game is as bright as it's updates.",1,0

106000,The Cursed Crusade,"Cursed Crusade is a 3rd person hack and slash taking place during the Fourth Crusade in history and follows a story of Denz, a templar who set out to find his father who hasn't returned from a previous crusade, and Esteban, a mercenary who is always after gold but gets mixed up in the crusades and becomes Denz' best friend.  The game spans a few dozen of missions in various locations of the world. The missions for the most part just require you to participate in sieges and battles, and are mostly combat-oriented. Some of the battle scenes are executed really well and feel epic in my opinion. A few of the missions here and there do something different, like have a boss fight or find yourself in a nightmare where you learn new powers.  To me the best part of the game is the combat. It's fun, rich, and visceral. You can choose to use any weapon combination ranging from maces, to axes, swords, and even spears. You can use a weapon as stand alone, or you can dual wield, or wield it with a shield. There are some two-handed weapons too. Each weapon stance has its own unique moves and unique executions. In addition, weapons can break during combat, so you often have to change what you use as you pick up new stuff from fallen enemies. Sometimes this mechanic can be a tad annoying, but it makes sense in the context of the game and at least encourages you to try out new weapon combinations.  You learn new moves and improve your attributes after completing missions. At the end of each mission you earn Victory Points. There's a default amount for each mission, but many also can grant you bonus points if you've done secondary objectives such as found all the coffers or purified a crucifix.  The combat also features a curse mode. When the player enters curse mode, the environment around them turns all fiery akin to hell, they become stronger and fight more effectively, they can use fire spells, and they also find weakspots in walls and other structures, which they can smash to make a new doorway.  Admittedly the game is heavily combat-focused. So if you're expecting platforming or other types of gameplay, you won't find them here, aside from occasional first person shooting with a crossbow. I don't personally mind this too much, as platforming wouldn't make sense in this game. Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is very heavy on cutscenes, some of which can be lengthy.  The story felt so-so. It starts off on a promising note with some good chemistry between the two main protagonists who quickly become best friends, and the antagonist seeming very charismatic and perhaps even noble to a degree, but in the second half the story starts going vastly downhill. The plot feels very unfocused, with no build up to climax. Just very random events happening. The antagonist becomes a 2-dimensional cartoon villain who wants evil for the sake of evil. And the ending does not resolve anything at all and feels very abrupt, as though the story was cut at a midpoint.  Overall the game is definitely worth trying out. I think most of the critic reviews are way too harsh on it and the game is not as bad as most of them make it out to be. Sure, it has some strange hiccups here and there, like the annoying quick-time event in the very first mission where you have to escape Death (honestly, don't give up on the game at this point; this part is the hardest part of the game if I am honest). But in general I can't deny that I've had fun playing it and I think anyone who is up for a nice story-driven hack and slash should enjoy it.  A couple of last notes:  1) The game can also be played co-op with a friend. I've not tried it myself, but since the two main protagonists are always together, I believe the game was made with co-op aspect in mind from the very start.  2) I would highly advise to play with a gamepad, as the controls for it seem much better and more intuitive than with M&amp;K.",1,1

10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"I picked up this game because I heard good things about it on the Angry Joe Show and it was recently on sale. I have to say I underestimated the content in the game. The three campaigns may be short on their on but together they make a game that is twice as long as most shooters today. Playing as the marine gives me the feeling that I had hoped Aliens Colonial Marines would. Having to survive on your own while rarely running into other survivors. Playing as the predator makes you feel like exactly that. A hunter preying on weaker, less equipped marines and xenomorphs. And the trophy kills it performs are absolutely BRUTAL! Now playing as the xenomorph may be disorienting for some, but once I got used too playing as one I found that sneaking around in the shadows and striking from the dark was extremely satisfying. Especially when I could hold someone down while a facehugger comes to impregnate them. I have not yet tried the multiplayer, which I hope still has some players. But I can't wait. All in all, I found this title as pleasantly surprising and with more substantial singleplayer content than most shooters out even today.

107100,Bastion,"Bastion brings you in as The Kid. One of the few survivors to the Calamity in the world of Caelondia. Travel the world (levels) to find the cores and shards the were left in the aftermath of the disaster to bring back to life The Bastion. The beauty and color that this game brings with the deep system of ugrades and different weapons offers a kind of RPG to mind. This has been one of the most beautiful, creative and luscious games that I have ever played, seen and heard since I have started gaming. Even with its downfall of being a bit short, its story is so well played out that you will play it to experience it at least twice.  Pros: Beautiful, colorful, creative, different.  Cons: short (even though this doesnt mean this makes it anything less than a good game.)  9/10",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Bastion is a beautiful game. The game play flows well, very intuitive, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the artwork is gorgeous. Think a pretty version of Diablo. You hack and slash your way through amazingly well fleshed out environments and are able to customize the upgrades your weapons. The music is amazing, so I'd recommend buying the version with the soundtrack included. The narrator has a rich, smooth, cowboy voice and the storyline is intriguing. It's never boring, and although the enemies don't have many variety, the colorful worlds bring this game to life. I played this on a PC and had no troubles with the controls what so ever. This game is not easy however. You can however chose to have unlimited amounts of lives which helps greatly, especially when you don't care to dodge or block any of the attacks being tossed your way. Great game. 9/10",1,0
107100,Bastion,"The best indie game so far, in my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of this kind of camera view, but the way everything happens visually in Bastion really captured me. It's stunningly beautiful, and the soundtrack, you'll love every and each song. But the best part of it, story aside, is the narration. It really fits the mood of the game and keeps it up 'til the very end, and even after it.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"I picked up Bastion when it was on sale with the Humble Bundle. I really just wanted to get my hands on trine, and the game soon fell into dark corners of my game library. A few days ago, for some mysterious reason, i installed it and played it, expected yet another indie game. Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a 'small team made it against all odds in their own garage'.   I would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own. The game art and world work flawlessly, the innovitave and dynamic narration system makes the whole tale all the more engrossing, and the soundtrack is exquisite. I won't go into details about the game elements, for half of the pleasure is discovering what next the game throws at you. This game is an achievement of human ingenuity, a must play for everyone!",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Fair warning:  I will most likely be gushing for duration of this review, about how brilliant this game is.    The art direction and graphical assets complement the isometric perspective.    The music stands out being one of the more solid sounds tracks I've heard in recent dates.'    The game play is simple; yet deep enough to warrant multiple play throughs.    The story is nothing short of a brilliant.    I'd highly recommend this game to anyone; it's one that simply can't be passed up.   Cons: Very few. I once had a interface issue, but it was resolved with a simple restart.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Similar in gameplay to an action RPG like the original Zelda, this game is worthwhile for any casual or hardcore gamer that loves a good story and a challenge.  Hand-drawn art combined with an original musical score from a fabulous independant developer! This is gaming at it's finest. It isn't some sandbox open world, certainly, but what it does, it does better than most!  I'd give this game a 10/10. Exceptional.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"This is truly an excellent experience. I got it for $7, and best $7 I think i ever spent on a game.  -You hear everyone talk about the narration throughout, and yeah, i got to admit it really makes the game a unique experience. The constant narration isnt irritating at all surprisingly, and does a LOT to emphasize an otherwise quiet game.  -There are nice options, such as the 'visions' you can play through to learn more about the characters, and even a very seemingly necessary 'new game +' option when you 1st beat it. creative storyline, interesting twists, and simple to figure out dynamics all work very well.  -The only downside, is with 4 playthroughs you can accomplish almost everything, minus baiting the 'gods' without much work.

107100,Bastion,"Bastion is one of the most interesting games I've ever played in the narrative aspect.  From the constant narrator, to the story, to the endgame choices, I felt myself drawn to it's characters and style. You get to know more about a world you only experience through the narrator's account, and even then, it sounds like the most amazing civilization ever created.  It's gameplay is also very good, although it may suffer from control problems sometimes. It's a kind of cross between Diablo and Zelda. You get to experience the game from a isometric perspective, but instead of mindless button mashing, like in Diablo's MvP, you have a dodge button, a lock-on mechanic, and get to choose two weapons to take with you. It's upgrades keep things ever fresh, and the game is constantly challenging you with every new map. Bastion really desevers to be played. It's a masterpiece.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"Tl,dr: Is this a good game? Yes. Is this what you would expect a 97% positive reviews game to be? Probably not.  So why the hype? Because the game's absolutely gorgeous. The music, the visual style, the narrator are ravishing each on their own, and combined they can hit like a truck, straight in the feels. The overall effect is just massive. By the way, I think buying the OST DLC is totally worth it.  Why don't I think it's a perfect game then? Well, it's somewhat boring at a low level. Fighting is pretty much what you do most of the time and it's quite repetitive. Sure, there are different kinds of enemies and different combinations of them, but for each kind of enemy you just repeat the same trick over and over again to defeat them and it doesn't really matter what combination is thrown at you.  So why do I recommend it? Because I think it's good anyway. Just don't expect it to be so good that you'll play it for ten hours straight until you finish it, completely disregarding the real world in the process. Expect to completely disregard the real world only for about an hour or two at a time.  PS I cried a little at the end.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Proper review's supposed to start at the beginning. Ain't so simple with this one. The kid's story twists on and seems broken in its presentation, but the world seems to fit this delivery, and the ending is worth the trouble of a fragmented narrative. On the action, the kid swings a hammer like he's got a score to settle with every pillar and windbag in the joint, and just when you think he can't take anymore, he doesn't. But then he does again. The play seems unbalanced at times, but it just pushes you forward and makes you put in the effort. It isn't punishing, it's just honest.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"Bastion is a wonderful little action game with an extremely creative twist in telling its story.  A lot of Steam gamers have probably acquired this through a Sale or whatnot, but if you haven't played it yet or are still looking to buy, Bastion combines action-platforming with RPG elements as you guide your hero through worlds created beneath your feet as you traverse through them. Players choose two weapons and a special, which grow with your character through bought or created upgrades. What makes the game truly unique, though, is the overarching narrator that follows your actions as you collect the worlds' cores and discover more about the lands surrounding Bastion.  It's a genuinely fun game, and neither the narration or action get too stale. The art design is gorgeous, and the game features possibly one of the best soundtracks in recent gaming history. Everything combines to make a nice little success story for a game that flew under-the-radar for quite some time before being picked up as almost an indie darling. When it's on sale, it routinely goes below the $5 threshold and is a steal at those prices.  I really can't recommend this enough as one of those games that will give you a great bang for your buck if you're a budget gamer.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"Bastion is really hard to describe.  Even though most people would simply put it as an 'indie hack'n slash', I'd say it is more than that. Way more.  Bastion tells a story of a child in search for an answer. You take control of this child while someone tells you an amazing tale, step by step, of what you do and what is happening. Everything through gorgeous visuals, amazing story-telling, fun gameplay and a really nice soundtrack.  The game has everything to be the best of its kind.

The beautiful environment, the deep, calm voice of the narrator and the story, all come together in an out of the ordinary exiting game that draws you in and entices you to keep going.  Sadly I don't think there is any real replay potential as it is the feeling and story that keeps you going. Bastion is a Hack'n'Slash game seasoned with some RPG elements. The combat system is decent and can be compared with Diablo or Path of Exile, and you have enough customization option to keep you excited about getting levels and new stuff all the way through the game, which took me about 7 hours.  Bastion is definitely worth a try, at least to enjoy the awesome narration by Logan Cunningham.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Disclaimer: Bastion is one of my favorite games of all time. This review will reflect my feeling towards the game in a biased manner.   Basion is a wonderfully crafted Action RPG that brings together all the well needed elements of an Action RPG. The game has a great story, interesting combat that offers many options to the player, a nice RPG leveling system that adds to the game (Unlike a lot of games where RPG systems detract from the game), and a wonderful soundtrack that ties it all together. The game leaves the player when they complete it with satisfaction and a sense of a job well done.   The narrative of the game is interesting and omnipresent. The Narrator, Rucks who is voiced by Logan Cunningham, envelops the player with his voice allowing for the games story to unfold. Narration is an integral part of the game and without the narration this game would fall below what feelings I have towards it. The narration is tied to certain events in the game in which Rucks will talk about what is going on, what happened, and what could happen. The narration always brings the player back into the game and immerses them in Bastion's lore.   The gameplay of the game is interesting, but there is a down side to the gameplay; if the player doesn't want the game to be hard it can be a cakewalk. I know that I like to make a game challenging and as such I invoked 'Idols' which increases the difficulty of the game by a small margin. Invoking multiple idols can make the game challenging and very enjoyable to someone who doesn't like an action game in which all you do is 'Button Mash'. Bastion's core game can be played by button mashing; the purpose of which is likely to create accessibility to a younger audience. The game is challenging, enjoyable, and progresses in a timely manner introducing new mechanics in the game and allowing the player to get use to them, or if they should choose ignore a couple mechanics completely. Often I found myself using everything I could, but again that is because I like my game to be challenging.   The music of the game can only be described by one word: astonishing. The music feels like a United State’s western cowboy film’s soundtrack integrated with synthetic instruments and beats and it comes together perfectly.   Pros - Soundtrack is astonishing and helps make the game a masterpiece. - Narration is sets the tone for the game and it’s world. - Gameplay flows well and level design, movement, and progression is intuitive.  Cons - Gameplay can become a “Button Masher” if you don’t invoke “Idols” to make the game a more difficult experience.   This game is a must play to everyone and I believe it to be one of the best games to ever come out. Please pick up the game and give it a run. The game will leave you in awe.  I would give the game a 10/10",1,0
107100,Bastion,"So I beat the game I guess...I mean the ending was adequate but I didn't quite get the satisfaction I was expecting.  Besides that...  The music is awesome, the narration is actually very well done, this game has a no-sweat (aka casual) mode which is always a plus for me cause I suck at games lol... and I did enjoy the various challenges (proving grounds) that are available throughout the game.

107100,Bastion,"Bastion is a critically-acclaimed steampunk/fantasy-themed action RPG, and the acclaim is very justified. The story is very intriguing and well-executed, told in an amusingly sardonic fashion by an NPC/main character who serves as a narrator. The narrator even goes so far as to narrate the player's actions, but the narration isn't overdone and manages to avoid being annoying.  Combat is fun, yet challenging. The player gets to use some melee weapons (a hammer, a knife, etc.) and also some firearm/projectile weapons (bow, musket, rocket launcher, etc.). The challenge is customizable in that you can give yourself certain perks, or you can give the enemies their own perks. So, combat can be as challenging as you want it to be.  The game is relatively short, but it has a New Game+ mode, during which you can find an easter egg that allows you to summon Portal turrets straight from Aperture Labs (and even get one to interact with at the Bastion).  Anyway, don't hesitate if it's on sale.",1,0

107200,Space Pirates and Zombies,"I really enjoyed this game, I put a lot of hours into it, and was rewarded with an interesting story, lots to explore and heaps of combat.  What I like about it is that there's unlimited fights to have and things to explore, you can just wonder around the galaxy and fight endlessly. You can see the challenge rating of each star system, so you know what you’re in for before you go there, and if you want some relaxing fun you can just pop back to an easy system and kill everything with impunity. There are lots of spaceships to discover, and lots of weapons, that will suit your playing style and dexterity.  Combat is the central part of the game, you have a number of ships to field, and the AI is decent. Combat takes place on a 2D playing field, and you have a God’s eye view of the whole map, so finding things to shoot is easy. Sometimes it gets tedious racing around the combat map to reach waypoints, or protect space ships with no self-preservation instinct.  However, by the time I was ¾ of the way through the game it was getting tedious. I was only driven to complete the story, I could barely tolerate entering more combat because it was becoming repetitive. I did finish the game, and I did enjoy completing the story, but I can’t see myself playing a second time.  Overall, I recommended this game as a good distraction. Exploding enemy ships and capturing or shooting their crew after they eject is satisfying for a gamer like me.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Before you decide to downvote this review because its a negative recommendation, Please read. There are positive things about this game if you take your time to read this and/or the comments Ive posted below.  Bohemia have gone down hill, even if their game has enhanced somewhat, its not worth anywhere near the price they sell it at and the fact that you have to pay for small updates they call DLC's is disgusting, I completley regret buying this game, we've payed a bunch of greedy frauds.  The modding community could do better and their downloads are free. This is both disrespectfull to the average player and the modding community. Its like a 'Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself' outlook on the whole consumer market of ARMA titles.  Whilst I used to be a follower of ARMA titles, I refuse to accept the fact that bohemia are too ignorant to pay some kind of respect to the community, its beginging to look like a move EA would pull. -Youve brought our game for a overly-expensive amount of money and now that we release content that should have been present in the ALPHA version is now being released late so we can rip you off even more then we did before.

107410,Arma 3,"My story on Arma 3... This was not made up, I wrote this review for what it was likef or the first time... Before the war started... I remember watching on T.V. Where landing craft was landing on the Beaches and men were getting killed... I landed in the airport and I remember how people were signing up for the army. I ran through the grass in California, rushing to the airport to head to Afghanstan. After I landed, we landed in Europe somwhere. It get us half an hour to get though training. I fell asleep after a day. I woke up hearing the transports going by of Officers. I got up and looked around, I decided to go aboard my Heilcopter. I looked outside, the driver closed the Heilcopter down after my new sqaud got in. I looked as we passed the terrain, beatiful. Then we were going accross the sea. I still had my pistol out and tried to quickly figure out where my gun was. Then, I saw land, the same land and beach I saw on T.V. We landed a mile or two away from the beach. I didnt have time to figure out my equitment so I rushed with my sqaud. My sqaud was getting ahead of me. Heilcopters and airplanes were everywhere above me. I kept running, my sqaud split up, I kept falling my objective to follow my leader. I looked ahead and saw fences and tons of troops. I finally got my gun out and rushed accross grass and fences.  All of a suddden, gunshots started to fire, I didnt know where so I kept running. A sharp pain in my hand and I dropped to the floor taking cover. I kept crawling until my worst enemy was in front of me: The fence. I decided to get up and run, I kept running until I reached the troops running in the dirt. Then, my sqaudron started to move out to the town. On my way I saw men surrounding a man. The man was dead, I heard gunshots all over again. The man checked the boddy and the dead man got up. The sniper was shot by his own teamate. I rushed to where the sqaudron was and they healed the man, appolgizeing. I kept rushing through, all of a sudden, 'Mission accpomplished men, onto the next objective'! I lost my team everybody spreaded out. A Heilcopter was picking a man up, I rushed to it and it took off without me. I decided to head back to where I ran through the fences. I kept running, I noticed that I was thirsty, I was tired. I kept running, trying to figure out my radio. Pressing buttons all over. All of a sudden, I pressed one button and talked into it: 'Hello, Hello this is Robert, this is my first time fighting and I need a medic!' I repeated the same sentence this time louder. No reply came to me and I was worried I would die  Sweat came accross my face as I looked into a empety Heilcopter. I got in and he took me further into the fighting, not back to H.Q. I never knew when the battle was gonna be over. I frogot my Journal on the other Heilcopter and noticed this Heilocopter from H.Q. The ride was longer, we passed many farms in ruins and a city. The heilcopter stopped and dropped me off, alone. Another Heilcopter came in and quickly a man jumped out of it. I remember a attack Heilcopter above me. I ran to the village and was shot multiple times. I turned quickly and got on the ground, I was shot in the back.  I fell asleep. I woke up back at H.Q. wondering what was happening. 'go go go!' A man shouted as cars passed by. I was eager to get back into the Chopper. I got in and there was a bigger, new sqaud in the Heilcopter. They wispered plans to eachother. I started to write my first battle but time went by and everybody got out. 'Robert, go go go!' The man shouted, I got out and the heilcopter waited a second then lifted off the ground. This time we landed in the same spot I stayed with my team this time but the same comamnder came on the radio. 'Great job you have taken the objective'. Our team ran to the forest silently. Our sqaud commander took his binoculars and looked ahead. 'Retreat!' Kept repeating on our radios. A half an hour later, armour was spotted and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself. We were under fire and multiple jets were spotted. A artillery shot fired and the civillian that came with us fell to the ground. The Marine got his SAW and fired it.  We moved into the town and we thought the two heilcoptesrs were enemy heilcopters. We got into one of the Heilcopters and we waited for a long time for many people to get in. Ranger sqaud got in with snipers and a civillian got in. WE lifted off the ground and this time it felt alot more scarier. All of a sudden while I was about to say somthing a huge hole went into the glass and hit the machine gun and almost killed the sniper. Bullets were everywhere and there were jets outside picking us off. I wanted to get out but everything was down. Nobody moved and we were going on. The heilcopter exploded and we all flew out. A pack of us layed there. I was gonna call for a medic but I couldnt reach it. Nobody could find us. We were all lost. All I could do was finish my story and await for sombody to find me.      Thanks for reading this was my first time and im eager to do my 2nd adventure and then get some mods like the zombie mod and Colonial mod!!!",1,1

107410,Arma 3,"A great first-person shooter that's been around for a while now, but has been kept fresh thanks to the DLC and the mod community. There's a lot of love gone into this series, especially with the Tanoa map. It simply is a beautiful map to play. The only issue with this game is the resources the engine uses. It's infamous for sapping CPU cycles. But there's lots of help on the forums with assisting you tweak the game to provide the best FPS possible.  If you're wanting support for this game however, it is best to use Steam's community Arma 3 forum, as the official BI Arma 3 forum is now run by some (not all) overzealous moderators who move, delete and lock threads for no real reason other than they're not adhereing to whatever it is they believe is 'their' interpretation of the rules. In short, if the mods don't agree with or like your post, they'll move, delete or lock it.",1,0
107410,Arma 3,"I knew what to expect going into Arma III from previous experience with Bohemia Interactive games, yet I was still overwhelmed by the amount of features I had to wrap my head around before I could play it with even moderate proficiency. It’s a first-person shooter alright, but it’s not another “left trigger to aim down the sights, right trigger to shoot” kind of game. You’re going to have to use almost every key on your keyboard, memorize specific key combinations and what each does depending on whether you’re on foot, in a tank, a helicopter, etc.  I felt comically inept fumbling through my first few hours. With so many different firing modes, stances, movement speeds, and other options, I had difficulty just walking, drawing my weapon and firing, to say nothing of using my equipment, making sense of the map, and working with my squad. I had to wonder what my AI squadmates thought of me, the clueless rookie, stumbling into the bushes before I accidently pulverized myself with a satchel charge I didn’t even mean to deploy.  To make matters even more difficult, in its current state Arma III doesn’t offer a real tutorial. Its Showcases (playable scenarios showing off its many features) follow a logical progression that introduce you to increasingly complicated mechanics. However, they each do a poor job of explaining how to use them or how they may be useful later on. The only real instruction comes in the form of on-screen hints that tell you which keys do what. It’s an inefficient method to teach you how to fly a helicopter, and practically useless when it comes to explaining the tactical value of more esoteric equipment and features.  In one of the more interesting Showcases you are given access to a non-lethal aerial drone and an armed ground vehicle drone which you can use to eliminate targets in a nearby town. After much experimentation, I devised a tactic of sending my aerial drone ahead to scout and tag targets, which then allowed me to coordinate mortar fire and corner enemies in the town. It was satisfying because it allowed me come up with a strategy which felt entirely my own, and one which nearly no other shooter could accommodate. On the other hand, there was a needless amount of frustration along the way that could have been avoided with clearer UI and better instruction.  As you can imagine, Arma III’s potentially much more enjoyable when you’re playing online with real people – especially those who already know how to play and can teach us its secrets. It doesn’t have a capped player limit, so in theory a server where 100 players are facing another 100 players in a gigantic sandbox where almost everything is possible is one of the best shooters I’ve ever played. But without investing long-term in a clan or other group that will ensure a reliable team of significant size, those are hard to come by. In practice, new players are presented with a list of servers half-full of random people who aren’t communicating, and where everything that can go wrong is going wrong. Since Arma III doesn’t offer obvious incentives for players to cooperate or even funnel them to the same areas of its enormous maps, multiplayer’s mostly uncurated chaos. It’s amusing in its own way, but something I would rather watch in a YouTube video than it play myself.  Counterintuitively, smaller matches are more fun for a new player trying to find his way in this world. In one pick up co-op game, six fellow players and I (and a group of AI bots) were tasked with a simple mission: find a way off the island. We spawned at a random spot along the coast and were given two locations, miles away, where we could find a boat or a helicopter for extraction. We ended up not even making it halfway to either destination, but I enjoyed our journey quite a lot. We heard a gunship in the distance and dashed across a field to take cover in a forest. We stumbled upon and successfully seized an enemy outpost, where we commandeered a truck. We arrogantly tried repeating the same strategy with a larger town on our way to an airfield... and were caught in the open by snipers. This is what developers mean when they talk about emergent gameplay, and it’s where Arma III shines.  Altis and Stratis, the two islands that serve as its massive military sandboxes (270 km² and 20 km² respectively), are truly impressive and the foundations that make everything else about ARMA 3 possible. Whether you’re scuba diving to disable mines or sniping from a church atop a high hill, everything looks crisp and sufficiently believable... as long as you don’t look too close. There’s an obvious amount of recycled assets used to fill all this space, and many empty buildings. With its overall clinical style, Arma III can seem sparse, even boring when you stop to smell the roses.  Its sound design, however, is disappointing at any distance. It suffers from laughably cheesy electronic music and sound effects that make some actions feel insignificant, vehicle movement and firing in particular. For all I know that’s what tanks and helicopters really sound like, but it makes them feel like toys.  But like I said, this is a game where we have to make our own fun, and at least Arma III makes that much relatively easy with a built-in mission editor and Steam Workshop integration. It’s inherited the modding community that brought us such hits as DayZ, and as its marketing materials insist, Arma III really is a “platform” more than a stand-alone game, and what it may evolve into in the months and years after release adds immeasurable replay value to its $60 asking price.  Arma III’s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once you’re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, you’re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that’s simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable, making Arma III’s nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know there’s a long, dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light.",1,0

It's really awsome and fun to play, the graphics just look amazing, the gameplay mechanics are better then in Arma 2 ( a lot better ). I don't like the DLC thing that they are doing, I mean Arma 3 got so much less weapons and vehicles then Arma 2 + expansions, and the idea of charging us 10-20€ for simple dlc like marksmen or helicopters that should be part of the main game ( beacuse there ain't much weapons in the game, atleast compared to Arma 2 ), I understand that you want to make money but atleast make the DLC 3-10€ MAX! It's just not worth spending 13€ on a simple dlc that adds few guns and a full ghillie, or few new helicopters, or if you are going to make expensive DLC's make them atleast bring much new content with them.  ~Ratings~ - Gameplay: 9/10 - Graphics: 10/10 - Story: 7/10 - Multiplayer ( best part ): 9.5/10 - Price: 6/10 ( beacuse of the expensive dlc but if i had to rate the price of the game without the annoying dlc: 8/10 )  ~~My overall rating is~~ 8.5/10... why?  - The game is worth buying, but as I said above, it has expensive DLC with not much content in it and it makes it hard to play the game without it ( mostly if you play mp you won't be able to acces the new weapons / vehicles and you are kinda in a disadvantage ).  - Sorry for my english, it's not perfect but I'm doing my best :) -",1,0

CONs: -Game is not fixed yet,needs more work to fix the bugs. -Map is loading so hard sometimes -Loading screen makes you punch the keyboard, it works so slow -Sometimes,it is so hard to crouch and sprint because you are gonna get stuck into surfaces -It is impossible to drive in A3L without having a laugh,your feets are visible everytime you are in the passager seat.

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 is a military simulation game released September 12, 2013. Even though it was release a few years ago, it's community stays strong and updates are persistant.   Gameplay, Arma 3 has amazing gamplay and smooth movements with VERY little lag. The game can seem somewhat complex when and if youre new to the game, but when you get used to it, movement mechanics and such are fairly simple. For example, I thought that helicopter control and the 15 stances it offers would be difficult to operate, I was wrong. Bullet drop, windspeed, and occasionally ricochete can play a big part in the games realism. The fact that you can move your head independantly from your body is very impressive, in my opinion. Coming with this is an amazing third person feature, useful for peeking around corners and over things. So unlike some fps games (there are more than i'd like there to be), you are more than just a pair of floating arms and a gun, instead you have a full body, with multiple stances to maximise cover and concealment.  Single player, The game also features an emersive campaign that    makes you feel very helpless at multiple times, such as making your way to Lacey on Stratis    . You can also make your own missions and situations in the scenario editor, that you can post to the workshop. Making your own levels and just playing around can really up replayability.  Multiplayer, Arma 3 has many gamemodes to fit different players, my favourite being Wasteland. The amount of vehicles and different weapons and clothing keeps it fresh, and adds more variety to the game. You can meet some very nice people in servers allowing up to 128 players to join at the same time.   I would definetely recommend this game to everybody, but, I would wait for it to go on sale.

107410,Arma 3,"Hands down the most imersive and realistic FPS wargame out there. It reminds me alot of Wargame: Red Dragon; a RTS war simulator, it feels like the perfect pair to that game. If you ever wanted to take a more hands on apporach in war, this is for you.  Now that all being said, it is completely misused by hordes of immature dweebs playing the mods and role playing.  Its like dungeons and dragons.  If you are like me and you think all of that is pretty gay...  you will find VERY few populated servers with a game similar to the single player experience. Which I think is lame because that is what I believe was the intention of the developers, a war simulator, not a ♥♥♥♥ing free roam 'life' game.  And quite frankly I feel quite jipped out of my money to find that the servers in MP were all only little kid mods.  sigh...  When you can actually PLAY the game, its fun.

107410,Arma 3,"Me experience with Arma started with 2nd part. I have always complained a bit on lack of realism in other military shooters. Arma3 compromise not a lot, focusing on what is important. Game has steep learning curve, and you need mouse with plenty of buttons - and uber keyboard skills to tackle this game. Reward is amaizing tactical gameplay you get online.  (and with a bit of skill you can map ps3 controller to cover most vechicle functions and basic movements for that crucial moments)  PROS Annimations has been improved a lot! Game models looks great in detail Awesome mod support and workshop integration Hours of fun on large map Mostly good online community of players. Steep learning curve filters out COD style kids.  CONS Maps feel empty and 'too clean' sometimes. Lack of grittyness  Still no secondary weapon in holster - Cmon I can forgive no SP campain on release date.. but not fixing simple bug like that on time? Poor SLI performance (10% improvement - or is it just me?) Lack of decent tutorial  Overall Arma3 is great fun, even more if you have few people to play with, as VOIP is must. There is few things that should be ironed out and polished before game should have 'released' status in my opinion as beta was really ok, to keep works in progress and release final product with all fixes applied. But I would recommen this title for more advanced military shooter lovers. Expect to run.... a lot!  Overall  8/10",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"To start off I want to say that Arma 3 is a great game. This game is not your average shooter (call of duty, battlefield, etc.) So if you're expecting that, this may not be your game. Arma 3 does have it's issues, but if you have the computer to support this game, then those issues arent really even noticeable. This game can be VERY frustrating at times, but the realism and simulation that it brings keeps me coming back. The game offers two great maps; Stratis and Altis, which are great. But with the steam workshop and Armaholic you can get many more maps, and countless mission, scenarios, weaponry, equipment, and more. This game is the full package for anyone in the market for a good, realistic, military shooter/simulator.  P.S. FOR MODS USE ARMAHOLIC. NOT ARMAHOLICS!!!!  Ive heard bad things about armaholics, not sure if its true, but I wont take my chances. Use Armaholic (NO 'S')!",1,0

Game crashes right when I click 'multiplayer'. Says memory couldn't be read (i've got 16gb, no issues elsewhere) 3) can hardly do any single player because the majority of it is labeled as 'premium content' and requires further purchase  Worst $30 I've spent on steam in a long time, maybe ever. If a game is this broken right out of the box after 2+ years when there are plenty of other games that just released that are flawless, it should go on sale for $5. You're lucky I want to play the damn game, otherwise I would just ask for a refund. You better have good customer support Bohemia.",-1,0

107600,Waves,"A fantastic Astroids-esque game. If you've ever played Geometry Wars then this is very similar - in fact, a lot of the game modes are almost identical (with slight twists like bomb pads instead of gates like in Geometry Wars) . That being said, if you're looking for a game to compete against yourself and friends this is it. I've found myself saying 'just one more game' over and over with this one.   My favorite thing about this game is that the duration of play time is totally up to you. If you only have 5 minutes to play, you will still easily be able to play a full round. Likewise... If you have 5 hours to kill, prepare to get mad at yourself and have a blast doing it.  Pros: Great visuals and music, addicting gameplay Cons: Limited selection of game types, leaderboards are implemented poorly and are slow to browse  7/10",1,0

108710,Alan Wake,I had this game for the xbox 360 and I loved it. The gameplay + narrative combo puts you literally right into the story (since the game is about a writer and his 'pages' are coming to life in forms of nightmares).

110400,inMomentum,"(Rage)quit the game near the end of the second level after getting stuck for close to ten minutes. Should've probably just slowed down the time and taken it nice and slow, but I felt like trying to go fast. Perhaps too fast for my skill level. The (quite uninnovative and bland) tutorial also accounts for a large part of my playtime.  Might be fun with friends, but apart from that the multiplayer seems to be dead. The single player content (just speedrunning the game trying to get to the top of the leaderboards or trying to farm the achievements) also doesn't seem too interesting to me, although I like both of those things in games where the core gameplay resonates with me more deeply.  Had some problems with the movement (lots of it due to missclicks, didn't quite get used to space as the shoot button, but then again how should I rebind the keys otherwise when there are two separate jump buttons?!) or maybe I just didn't grasp the basic mechanics behind walljumping as sometimes it didn't seem to reset when I thought it would/should.   Honestly feels more like a platform for making a game / a playground rather than a complete project. Aesthetics were passable, but in my opinion nothing too special.",-1,0
110800,L.A. Noire,I only have a few words for this game.The most perfect game i have ever played since Half Life 2.,1,0
110800,L.A. Noire,"This is really quite sad example of how the game industry sometimes works. The game may not be on the top shelf of quality, barely fitting 'the solid-good' one. And yet it IS a good game. And not in the way of 'guilty pleasure' good, no. This title is a great example of a sereis in which the second one corrects every mistake of the first one.   Unfortunatelly we do not have the possibility to play second one and we are left with this flawed piece of a 'sketch'. And whilst it is a quite nice idea for a drawing, it is not by any means perfect one. Starting with a mediocre graphics, very hard to rate depending on which side we are looking at (faces and interiors are really nice, the rest is... meh). The gameplay is I'd say quite poor and very repetitive.   And yet this title took more than 20 hours of my life. And I do not regret it at all. Because as far as the plot, the character, the music adn the climat goes the game is just outstanding! I could really, (without any problems whatsoever) close an eye on a technical side in this case. Take it without a hesitation if you are the player for whom the story development is more important than a gameplay. Especially if you liked the Sabouteur and you are keen on the 40s, noire, and jazz",1,0

110800,L.A. Noire,"Don't even think to compare this game to GTA-series. It's very different from some stpd thug-simulator like Watch_Dogs or GTA. Playing this game requires you to roleplay a detective of LAPD. Game is very immersive. City outside the buildings is vivid and alive. Graphics and sounds are very good. Act like a restless and proud detective. Drive retro cars carefully, stop at traffic lights if not in a hurry, embrace the atmosphere of 40's, listen to some flavor music while driving to settle your mind boiling with clues and suspects from current case. Interogate victims and suspects, look carefully and gather clues at crime scenes, don't get shot in firefights and get upperhand at HtH brawls. Take your part in ongoing plot. Interogation logic could'be weird at times, but doesn't break immersion or plot. Cases could be solved faster if you ask right questions and find important evidence upfront. This promotes replayability of the game.  Verdict: This game is incredible if played right! Highly recommended.",1,0

The game had a great way of building up your confidence and happiness, then to crush all of it at the end. Many unique puzzles, crimes, cases, and very fitting atmosphere in a VERY realistic 1940s Los Angeles. Unfortunatly, the city was a bit under utilized, and although there was quite a large map, it lacked that many places to explore and do things at. R.I.P. Detective Phelps :(",1,0

111100,Snuggle Truck,"It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)",-1,0

111800,Blocks That Matter,"A very dull puzzle game, with an infuriating UI.  Even for me who isn't a puzzle game fan, the game is rather easy. The optional challenges provides actual challenge, but trying to play the game is an exercice in frustration. There is no way to rollback a move, so if you've made a bad move by mistake, you may have to replay the whole level entirely.  The 'rewind time/rollback previous moves' is something that many modern puzzles games offer to avoid unnecessary frustration, but apparently, Block That Matters didn't get the memo. Worse, since the 'run' button is the same as the main action button, theses mistakes will happen a lot.  Similarly, if you pause the game, you're supposed to use the 'A' button of the Xbox 360 pad to go back to the game. But if, by mistake, you use the 'B' button because most games use that, Block That Matters will happily throw you back to the level selection menu, erasing your progress in the current level, without a warning.  I have only been able to go through half of the game, not because i was finding it complicated, but just because all theses UI mistakes and forced restarts made me rage quit the game after 2h.",-1,0

The music is pretty good but their some issues with programs that run in the background, which may cause you to lose where you are in a level and have no choice but to start the level over. Also if you are on a laptop and you happen to use a game pad for input disable power management while playing as it will cause you to lose your place in a level if the laptop tries to go into suspend.    EDIT:  Playing this game second time and i have to change my stance, last time I was playing with the keyboard and the controls were okay, however playing this gme with a gamepad (of any type) just sucks!!! The run button always makes your guys drill into a wall when you dont want to, to the point where I want to bash the ♥♥♥♥ out of the controller because this game shouldnt be this hard on a gamepad, it just shouldn't I get everything from input lag to just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls,    I recommend this game if you want to play with a keyboard, if not... stay away from this game unless you hate your gamepad and want to bash it into a million pieces by the end of the game.",-1,0
11190,Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper,"Do you like classic Victorian era Sherlock Holmes? Are you intrigued by the Whitechapel murders of 1888? Then you will love this game!  Cleverly the game developers have meshed together these two iconic characters into one very plausible story. You play as Detective Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr John Watson either in first or third person perspective (depending on taste) as you investigate the five canonical victims of Jack the Ripper.  While this game suffers from PS2/Xbox era graphics (It looked dated even at its time of release) it does however still manage to conjure up a very detailed, authentic, and atmospheric London of the period.   Puzzles can be frustrating at times especially those that do not directly impact the murder cases themselves but overlook this fault and there is plenty to enjoy here.   I would recommend this game and I give it a solid 8/10",1,0

The story is witty, the modes are fun, there are a lot of workshop content that you can play after the campaign. I also have to add that I loved the crunching sounds made by the cleaner when you 'crush' a victim. You can play it alone, but co op makes it really fun, especially pvp is a blast! (especially if you have c4)   It's not difficult or complicated, but it's challenging and fun.

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"Where do I start? This game is extremely frustrating to get the hang of. Unless you are a god, you probably can't beat it the first time you play. It took me 42 attempts to beat all six floors and Mom for the first time.  I guarantee you will lose your temper at this game at some point.  And you might have to do a bit of research on the Wiki or experimenting in-game to find out what every single trinket, activated item, passives and tarot card does and which ones are good or bad for every unlockable character.  You might have to take your chances with the pills, as each type is randomly paired with an ability during each run.  HOWEVER!  The Binding of Isaac is not, and I repeat, NOT, a bad game. As much as it is frustrating, it is really addictive. I thoroughly recommend this to fans of dungeon-styled and bullet hell games. Despite Isaac's innocent look (which he kinda is...look at those big crying eyes!), the style of enemies, rooms and pickups can be incredibly morbid and disturbing. The cries of Mulligans and the appearance of Hives are incredibly distressing, adding to the games overall atmosphere. Nonetheless this really adds charm to the game as a whole. Bear in mind this is coming from the creators of Super Meat Boy, so expect some blood along the way. But what's fun is you never know what to expect. All of the dungeon floor layouts are randomly generated everytime you start a game and aside from Mom being the last boss in the Depths, you never know what boss you will get upon entering its room. There are set bosses for every floor type and the game will randomly select one of these for you to battle. There is a sense of mystery about this game, mainly regarding the bosses, items you can find and what each pill does in every run.  Now stop reading this and go buy The Binding of Isaac!!",1,1

The glaring issues with this title seem to all be represented on the technical side of things: deleting temporary browser data /still/ wipes part of your save file, no steam cloud support, limited control configuration (no gamepad support).

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"Probably the first game I've ever played where I can end up both disliking it and adoring it all at once the reasons for enjoying it are:  - The graphics are nice - the music is ok but it does get very repetitive quickly,which can get annoying (I tend to play without the music) - there's lots of hours of content to this game which is good and makes it worth the price.Whether full price or on sale, it's a bargain. with the perma death feature you can get so many hours out of it, and it can get addictive and is easily replayed as each time you play it, it's different.  - the amount of things you can unlock making the game have more than one target.  however I dislike it for:  - trying to get as far as you can with the things you have(things you collect from other rooms to 'boost' the character you're using) felt like lotery/pot luck, as it requires no actual skill and is just pure luck the frustration becomes tiring after a period of time(5-6 hours) so for that only reason I found myself disliking the game,  You play this game if you want to never get out of your house ever again and want to hurl abuse at your monitor for hours.  if you can't afford rebirth, with the dlc on this game the two are basically exactly the same and works out much cheaper.   9/10",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.  But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.  In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.  This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'  But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.  We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.  It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.  The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.  And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, 'When will you be satisfied?'  We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.  We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating 'for whites only.'  We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.  No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.  I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.'  I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.  This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, 'My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"Although it was made by the makers of super meat boy and was a npleasant take on the original legend of zelda, it isn't too great, as it feels much like a flash game that should be free because of it's lack of features, levels, game mechanics, and save mechanic. This game is basically a watered down and satanic version of the legend of zelda.  The art style is lovingly kept from super meat boy and that was a good idea because the music and the art style were my favourite part of the game and i'm glad websites like grooveshark and youtube exist to make the best part of this game free  The game may lack bugs (ironic since bugs are a type of enemy) it doesn't make the game perfect, it just puts a rose between a thousand thorns because it is tedious, poorly made and a HUGE step down from super meat boy and i definitely would not reccomend it to anybody who doesn't like paying for flash games",-1,1

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"Extremely Addictive Roguelike Dungeon Delving game. Combat is 4 way directional, but movement is free form and can affect the path your tears, which are your weapon, so they curve. You got 4 basic stats speed range of tears tear reload speed and damage. You also can collect items which affect your health, giev you special abilities for your space bar which can only have one at a time but can pick up new ones. Items also can boost your basic stats and affect your tears like turning them into a laserbeam.. The game doesnt tell you what any item does other than when it boosts a stat or hp so alot of it is trial and error. You can find pills or tarot cards which give you a 1 room use thing or a permanent stat boost like pills that increase a stat and a tarot card that teleports you to a random room. There are three items you can stack which are pennies, bombs, and keys which help you do things. Also can be played in one sitting easily, butt change each time for replayability.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"The roguelike-like that I most enjoy getting frustrated at. Start off as a helpless child surrounded by horrible fleshbeasts, pray to the Random Number Gods, maybe become a destroyer of all who oppose you, likely die. A lot. Fun to play and discover the uses of every item on your own. Learn how to read enemies' tells and avoid damage! Fail anyway and get hit in the face! Have a lucky run and be friends with the RNG! Step on spikes and die anyway! Die constantly until you get better! And have fun the whole way!  The Wrath of Lamb adds more fun items, monsters, and death. More enemies, more items, more ways to die! More ways to win!  BoI isn't perfect, but there's both good and bad bugs. It's a good game and I highly recommend it, the WoL DLC, and the soundtrack.  [edit]  The Eternal Update. Well. While I'm glad that Florian decided to give us bonus DLC to a game that we all thought people were done with, it's not well implemented. It's got some great and unique ideas, but it's not balanced.  Eternal enemies follow the lazy route of 'double it'. Twice the health, attack two times per loop, twice as many projectiles or minion spawns. Boss battles take way too long and you're not even guaranteed an eternal heart drop.  And the bugs. Dear God, the bugs. Nothing is quite as infuriating as losing because the game breaks. Like when the framerate hiccups and then suddenly comes back and you got hit 5 times and you're dead. Or the items just stop working. Or a shop spawns in instead of the final boss.  TL;DR - hard mode, more like fake difficulty mode  [edit 2]  Patches have made Hard Mode more fair, but it's still tedious and frustrating. You need to be OP in order to even stand a chance of beating it, moreso than the original game. Still needs bug fixing and balancing, but it's getting there.",1,0

When I started playing this game, the disgusting elements the game had made me a bit uneasy (those poor Mulligans/Hives), but as I continued to play the game, I got used to it. This Flash game is quite an achievement by Edmund McMillen (behind Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥) and Florian Himsl. The items in the game are morbidly creative, and you'll need them if you want to at least survive. The game has secrets that'll keep you wanting to play until you find them (unless you look them up online :P). The difficulty will make you refuse to give up and keep trying. There are also situations that'll have you tense, and rightly so because you do NOT want to die from carelessness when you've gotten so far with an awesome set of items, especially in the secret levels.  I recommend this game to anyone who can get it.",1,0

Too many ARMAS weapons, way too many re-skins in the marketplace as well. (even though I have purchased a decent bit from armas) Missions are very repetitive, but who really reads the descriptions of them. The objectives seem to spawn in different areas often, but you may end up with the same actions there. Defend this, raid that, kill the enemy. And this game still has, in my opinion, one of the worst communities in gaming. Do good last mission? Everyone thinks you hack. Did bad? Your a noob. Using a armas gun? Noob. Using a free gun? Hacker. Im not even going to say anything about G1. EA is a better company, and look at what they did with BF4.

You need a lot of practice to get good at all the different weapons and you need to put in a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hours to level up and unlock weapons like osmaw (rocket launcher). When you finally get a grasp of what to do it offers the best pvp experience ever, but be warned players who are grouped up in clans are very difficult to beat which offers a lot of challenge.

Pros;   -Free -Easy to learn -Good for teaching / good first game to get into if youre trying to learn how to games -Doesnt take up much space -Runs really well / Isnt CPU nor GPU sensitive      Cons;  -Poor/Uninteresting/Generic Story -Looks like... Well, Pixel games are better. -Extremely repetitive/boring gameplay. -Enemies have the skill and threat of a one legged kangaroo. -Theres only like... One of each type of gun. (Im serious...) -PayToEnjoy.",-1,1
113420,Fallen Earth,"I really enjoy the game. It's primarily PvE (my preference), but there are places around the map that are PvP so tread carefully. At least they give you a warning about entering the PvP areas.",1,0
113420,Fallen Earth,"*Edit* I have more hours in this game than steam has reported  This could have been a exceptional game. The devs are completely out of touch with what direction they should take this game. Crafting is more or less useless, which makes gathering useless which in turn makes 50% of the game meaningless. PvP is hard to get into. It's geared to favor those who have been playing for a long time rather than skill. PvM is buggy, enemies can melee you from a distance, kinda reminds me of SWG in that reguard.   This is one of those games that could have been really great. But its also one of those games where the devs listened to a fraction of the player base and now you have a bad game with hardly any players. Those players who are active consider themselves elite.   The devs have promised so much in the past, such as housing, better more meaningful crafting and gathering, BALANCED PvP. and over the years only minor bug fixes are what they give.  I cant recommend this game as it is. It almost like its in constant beta. Such a shame.",-1,1
113420,Fallen Earth,i couldnt even play the damn game. i made my character simple enough but the moment i stepped into the starting area the game froze. so i waited until it unfroze and it did. once it unfroze i looked around with the camera and no issues. then i tried moving and froze again. repeted multiple times. apperently this is common and reproducable. the tells me that whom ever made this game either doesnt care about it or are dropping the game altogether. but all in all until this huge issue with the game is resolved you won't see me anywhere near it.,-1,0
113420,Fallen Earth,"Well, what can I say about this amazing game?  + For sure it's definitely better than the overhyped Fallout 4. - Graphic wise, it's not as good as Fallout 2, + but in terms of multiplayer and price, Fallout 4 can't beat that. + If you ignore the Freemium stuff, it can be pretty fun. Great community who are always happy to help you out. + Not sure what the negative reviews were about, as I have never encountered the said bugs. + But hey, at least it's better than APB Reloaded, right?  UPDATE #1: Now that I have spent at least 300 non-Steam hours I have some polished thoughts to share. + The humor and references present in the game is endless and incredible. Some of them are just meant to make you laugh. Not many game developers cared to do that. On a free game. + 650 achievements might seem a lot, but it takes time. It may seem grindy, but it's not. They are there to make sure you know something about the game (discover a town, complete their missions, unlocking their secrets etc.), not just spamming the kills and skills. + There are more than 500 weapons available (both melee and ranged), some of them provide different attribute boosts. + The game is not even dead. Those who say the game is dead probably never entered the /Global channel (you need to be a Freemium for that) which is very much alive.  UPDATE #2: I have discovered the Dark Side of the game (didn't even receive any cookies) - I started to have a lot of achievement bugs: achievements that do not get unlocked even the requirements are met. The devs never cared to fix them. One of the representatives on the forums replied 'it's random'... - Adding salt to the problem, help is harder to get nowadays with only the help of the unofficial wiki (which is so much incomplete even until now). I noticed third-party sites that supposedly provided more information or secrets about the game which little people knew about, were disabled (By Devs?). Players lingering on the /help channel do not have enough experience to deal with advanced issues, Hazmat volunteer helpers come online only at certain times of the day, GMs don't come online anymore (even if they do they'll log in in Ninja mode and spy on all of us)... so you see, it's terrible - Devs can lay the banhammer on absolutely anyone permanently without giving whatsoever reasons at any time, whether you may be a suspect of cheating or not. (Needs updating)  All in all, I think FE is ideal for you if you want to play it for a short period of time (say, ~200 hours), avoid being too immersed in the game like i did).  Update as of 25/11/2016: Dupers ruining the market, botters killing PvP, rerolls everywhere. that's just how you want the game to end.  Personal rating:  5.5  3.5/10",-1,0

It was fun, an interesting concept that runs adequately (sorta), the faction system was awesome, but ultimately, it's free, so the only thing you'll waste is time if you don't like it. It was fun while it lasted. No instanced zones, so it can be a mess at times, but it's fun to some degree. Does what it sets out to do in one way or another.

11450,Overlord,"Overlord has you take the role of the almighty Overlord, an evil presence who is set to rule over the land.  You begin the game, a newly awakened dark force – tasked with rebuilding your dark tower. You raise an army of minions, terrorize the local population and craft your own armour and weapons. You can even customize your dark tower, which is a nice touch. The narrative and environment are very reminiscent of Middle-Earth, in the sense of a twisted parody where you play as Sauron. The setting is very light-hearted and comical, despite playing the villain in a Tolkien-esque world. The graphics aren’t exactly stellar and there are issues with pop-in, but it does a nice job of portraying the theme of the overall experience. It’s similar to World of Warcraft’s style of softly lit and stylized environments and characters.  Although you are a dark and powerful Overlord, you start off fairly weak, which is where your minions come in. Like Pikmin, you need to gather a force of followers who can aid you in your quest. You need a certain amount of minions to perform specific tasks for you - such as moving obstacles, pulling levers and of course, combat. They can also access smaller areas otherwise inaccessible, revealing secrets and other goodies. There are also various colours which specialize further. Brown minions, for example, are your standard fighting force, whilst red minions are your ranged attackers; greens are your stealth attackers and blues are your healers.  Overlord plays like a very old game; now, I do not mean this in a negative sense – not dated or “retro” – I’m referring more to the game design and ideology. Although there is a main thread to follow, you’re not held by the hand from point A to point B, you are encouraged to explore and find things for yourself. The world is rather large and full of secrets and puzzles, which need actual work and thoughtfulness to find. It makes a very refreshing experience compared to more modern games full of set pieces and elaborately staged corridors.  The controls are very well done, both with keyboard &amp; mouse and a controller; although camera control is limited with a controller. You control your Overlord as you would expect, attacking and using magic but you can also control your minions directly as a horde, allowing finer control, such as sweeping them through inaccessible areas. You are also able to set guard points, sending your minions to station there until you recall them; this allows you to set your fire throwing reds at the back, set up an ambush with the greens etc. It’s nice how much control you have.  The game lasted me roughly 25 hours, which felt very well paced. Some games feel too long, others too short. This game fits neither of these categories.  I highly recommend this game, as I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it.",1,0

11450,Overlord,funny game nice option to be evil haha,1,0
11450,Overlord,"Fun concept and game, and the best part of the game is listening to the various comments your minions utter as they pillage, kill and cause mayhem, or as they fetch items for you or as you sacrifice them, he he he. It does get a tad repetitive after awhile though despite learning to control an increasingly diverse stable (hah!) of minions with different abilities which are necessary to solve increasingly complex (relatively so) puzzles as you progress through the game. The same can be said of the combat in that the Overlord himself has an extremely limited range of abilities and moves and you have to rely more on your minions to combat your foes, some of which can be quite tricky and require a good balance of minion types and careful management. I didn't finish the game due to its repetitive nature but it's fun enough that I may go back and finish it at some point.  7/10",1,0

115100,Costume Quest,"Gotta thank one of my besties, gogostar, for getting me this game. Because of it, I love Double Fine Productions and will definitely be keeping an eye out for future projects. It's supposed to be a children's turn-based RPG but only informed teens and adults would understand some of the more subtle humor. I couldn't help but be reminded of The Nightmare Before Christmas (you even get to battle as a Jack Skellington-like pumpkin) but less deranged. If you're looking for difficult, intricate gameplay, this isn't your game. It's got a lot of charm, funny dialogue, good feels, nice art style, and it's adorable as ♥♥♥♥. What other game would let you duke it out as a vampire, unicorn, and a pirate (my favorite in-game trio)?

115320,PROTOTYPE 2,The first game was a joy to play. Sandboxy and full of action.  Prototype 2 has all those elements and some more that would make it an awesome game. However it isn't due to extremely bad PC optimisation. The game is laggy on a rig that runs Battlefield 4 on rather good settings. That makes it a pain to play. I can't believe the engine went through the quality test.,-1,0
115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"The game was a lot of fun. I find it particularly refreshing when a sequel is not just an imitation of the original game, but actually a new game altogether. I played Prototype2 immediately after Prototype 1 and the experience was completely different and, in my opinion, better.   The controls felt a lot smoother in this one, the mechanics were more intuitive, hunting collectibles was actually achievable AND the rewards per collectible set were actually significant. The story was pretty nice too. The city looked particularly good, especially the red zone, with some really cool loooking damage to some of the buildings. I was hoping to witness some of that damage actually getting inflicted on some of the unharmed buildings, or some of that cool damage getting worse in an awesome cinematic of awesomeness and it didn't happen, but hey, that is a pretty small thing to complain about, which, once again, goes to show that it is a really good and fun game.",1,0
115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"Seems like it would be fun, but it's a console port so poorly optimized that it's unplayable. I picked this up in the 2015 Summer Sale, it has not been patched recently. This game is defective in its current state, DO NOT BUY.",-1,1

115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"I loved prototype 1, Had tons of hours into it on the console. but this... this is garbage. its plot is rushed and the entirety of the game is grocery missions ad nausium. I swear the designer wanted this to be a racing game because 1/3 of the missions are race against time, where you pick up boxes (and they give you a little time boost) meanwhile being shot out of the sky with rockets. For such a bad ♥♥♥ I'm not sure why it takes our hero so long to recover. I tried, I tried so hard to play this game to the end but it was just such trash I just couldn't. I'm somewhat of a completionist so the 20 hours I have into the game are not straight storyline. I doubt this poorly put together plot even has 20 hours if you run it straight. I am just so disappointed at how poorly this followed up such a great game. Not going to say its the worst sequel I've ever played but its definitely up there.   Honestly, Play the first one, its all you need and don't sully the memory with this poor sequel.",-1,0

115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"Barely takes about 6-9 hours depending on how dedicated you are to the story line. I ♥♥♥♥ed around with the civilians and did funny ♥♥♥♥ for about 2 hours and did some side-content for another 2. Then ate food for 1 hour and then beat the game in 8. Not worth much more than $20.

115320,PROTOTYPE 2,"Like the first Prototype, this game allows the player to kill everyone in a multitude of very satisfying ways. It's too bad some features from the original aren't there this time around- air strikes, patsy, armor, and hanging onto walls like Spider-Man, to name a few. Unfortunately, it's impossible to get all upgrades in one playthrough so if you're looking to fully upgrade Heller, be prepared to play the story twice. Boss fights start out hard encounters but after acquiring many upgrades, Heller can go to town on them like nobody's business. There are even upgrades that let you destroy tanks and helicopters with one button after hijacking them. In the rare case you get overwhelmed in a fight, just summon your pack of Brawler Hunters and you win. The only real challenges are the Goliaths and the last boss fight. Prototype 2 is still a very fun game though.",1,0

The first 5 mins I thought this is the biggest pile of crap I've ever purchased. Graphics are ugly, wave after wave in the same smallish map?!?! Why on earth are ppl still playing this game? I put it in my trash list.  The following day I had a strange urge to try it again, for whatever reason I don't know. I soon realised this game is not about arcadey run n shoot n regen health bs. This game's depth is about u as a team player and improving yr skills to take on bosses and tight situations. Reading the danger signs, when to run when to hold ground. You won't suddenly level up and get a powerful weapon, u only progress with improving yr gameplay.  The weapon mechanics are simply amazing. WARNING: after playing with no aim cursor and using only ironsights all other cursor games will suck.  Then there is the community made content. More guns, maps, zeds, bosses.....I have over 1500hrs entertainment time and I only paid $5. I think I bought some dlc just to support devs but its not enough for what they've achieved. I don't usually buy newly released games, the ones I've bought I've regret. But when KF2 comes out....just take my money, take it. Please.  TLDR: Buy the game.

1250,Killing Floor,"This game is pretty fun. Unfortunately, the fun ends when you aren't playing with friends, and the game doesn't have a lot of new things to offer after you've played it for a while. Of course, the implementation of special content, such as the recent 'Twisted Christmas Event' adds a bit more amusement, and refreshes the experience somewhat, but this isn't really a huge thing. Similarly, character pack DLC is a novel thing, but not enough to make the game 'refreshing.'

1250,Killing Floor,"First of all, I'd like to start my review with public apology to Tripwire Interactive and Killing Floor players: sorry, I've been dumb enough and I didn't get what Killing Floor was all about.  The first review that I've posted was written during second Killing Floor free weekend. I have tried the game for several hours and didn't quite get what these 'I've been playing this for 500 hours already' players been raving about. To me, gameplay simply felt nowhere near interesting as gameplay of similar team shooters such as Left 4 Dead 2. Fortunately, I am that type of gamer (person) that questions everything, including my own opinion. Getting Killing Floor on discount and playing some more, I've realized why and how wrong I was.  In case you haven't played Killing Floor before, it is a team based shooter. Similar to Payday 2 and Left 4 Dead, players are facing AI controlled enemies. However, Killing Floor allows up to 6 players to join Team Humans, and modded servers also allow for more than six players.  There are two game modes; Killing Floor is the main mode, where players encounter waves of enemies. Once you finish off the wave, trader appears on the map so you can upgrade your arsenal, buy more bullets or armor. It's pretty simple and its simplicity was what drove my opinion of game in wrong direction. Other mode is Objective where players need to finish several objectives on each map to win.  Killing Floor's aesthetics resemble those of Rob Zombie's; the game and its enemies seem like an interactive gory B-movie. Locations and enemies are based on A LOT of horror cliches and they will seem familiar to all lovers of macabre, sick and depraved works of art.  What I thought to be Killing Floor's weakness proved to be its greatest strength. To get fully immersed into a world of Killing Floor, you need to shut down your brain and let your reflexes do their magic. Killing Floor excels in providing fantastic teamwork experience: when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, you will need to rely on your teammates. All the Specimen (enemies) are faster and almost all of them are stronger than you, even those weak ones pose serious threat because they're attacking in swarms. You will need to learn to shoot, reload and strategically survey the maps watching your own and your team's backs.   Although it's run'n'gun game that reminded me of Doom franchise, additional mechanics make Killing Floor interesting. Perks system allows you to specialize in your team role and weapons usage. Perks are being leveled up by playing and achieving a certain milestones such as % number of headshots. What perks are actually doing, they're making you become a better player and learn to be more useful in sticky situations.  Solo mode seems rather pointless, but it is a good way to test your survival skills because when it's only you on the map and 120 bloody monsters with only one goal coming your way, you will learn to circle the map and shoot while moving. Like a real pro, bro.  It should be noted that some of the weapons in the game are locked behind DLC wall, but in case other players have DLCs installed, they can buy weapons for you. As for cosmetic DLCs, they are not necessary since they only unlock player skins. Since game is several years old, it works wonderfully on low-end PCs and you shouldn't experience any kind of technical problems.   Once you've seen it all, head over to Steam's Workshop and grab tons of free maps, weapon skins and additional modifications for Killing Floor. The only thing that will make you stop playing Killing Floor is that you'll eventually get bored. Even then, taking KF in small doses rather then uninstalling it is recommended, because game delivers the fun experience, no matter how much time you invest in it.   In the last few days, Killing Floor made me truly happy. I took some time for myself, rediscovered some classic death metal and shoot my way through one of the bloodiest forms of digital meditation. Killing Floor's price will surely be slashed this Halloween, so grabbing it for five bucks should be your top Halloween priority.  There, I've changed my review and rating. I can already feel it - peace and balance have been restored in the galaxy.  ***  Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it? It made you buy the game / abandon the idea of buying this game?

1250,Killing Floor,"I don't recommend this game to anyone. At first it was an hour a day, then 3, then 8 hours; I'm now at 12 hour days. When I wasn't playing the game I was thinking about it. Thinking about new tactic's, strategies, why I wasn't currently playing it. Thinking about how detailed the limited graphical game was, where everything everywhere had extreme details in the artwork. Newspapers actually had written articles; the random paintings/posters hanging on the walls in the maps were more detailed than the Paintings/posters in my apartment. The intense Gore, the screams of the Zeds, me screaming when a Flesh Pound is two feet away from me before I notice... The insanity that I go through when I play this amazingly designed game. When you have a full squad in your multiplayer co-op the fight gets even more extreme. With the already heavy difficulty that the game offers the Zeds numbers jump. Almost giving you the feeling that the algorithm changes per a teammate; the zeds begin to think differently, attack you with different strats.   The reason why I don't recommend this game is not because I find the game boring or poorly done in any way, in fact it's quite the opposite. The game is so intense and extreme in the levels of awesomeness that I've become addicted. I stopped talking to friends and family members, all that matters is that I'm able to defend my squad when it needs be. I've treied to stop, I've gone down on the hours of gaming, but the withdrawl is aching.",1,1
1250,Killing Floor,"Great horde mode game, with 6 different classes that give you different bonus for weapons, grenades and armor, around 70 weapons, some sold trough dlc, that is cheap, but you alread have a good selection even without it, around 60 weapons.  A mod community full of different maps, monster, character skins and weapons, and also with holyday events changing the appearence of the monsters.  It's repetitive and it takes a long time to lvl up the classes to max level, but it's tons of fun, and if you don't have the patience to lvl up the classes, you can get a save of another person to put yourself in max level.  Also, the game was made to be only coop, but there's alread mods to play pvp.",1,0

1250,Killing Floor,"I've been playing Killing Floor for years and it is without a doubt one of my favourite games here.  + The combat and carnage is unparalleled: explosions, dismemberment, and headshots look and sound great + The class and perk system is incredibly robust: classes have unique roles, pros/cons, levelling is addictive + Huge variety of weapons and maps adds a ton of replayability + Best free seasonal updates of any game out there  Fair warning, this is a skill-based game and it is difficult. Newcomers should start on Normal difficulty to learn the ropes and have fun. Playing on Suicidal and Hell On Earth requires a lot of experience, working as a team, and in-depth knowledge of game mechanics. For many people however - myself included - this is the real draw of the game. If you put in the time, playing on HoE with 5 other experienced players all working together is some of the most fun you can have online. There is also nothing more exhilarating than being the last one alive on Wave 10 knowing your entire team is watching and relying on you to stay alive.  Highly recommended.",1,1

They did this same sh*t in RO2.... WHY!?

The weapons and sounds and dismemberment are very satisfying, and the gameplay is tense and exciting. It contains a 'leveling' system so the longer you play, the more powerful your character can get in various classes.  The game also contains that 'second level' to gameplay. While the premise is easy -- shoot zombies -- but there are specific weapons and classes that are more effective against certain zombies and in certain situations. Learning all the ins and outs can make you very effective, but isn't always necessary.  Top that off with regular updates and events, non-invasive DLC, and a large playerbase, and you've got yourself a winner.",1,0

12640,Drakensang,"Drakensang is very well made crpg with strong feeling and themes of more classical or old school rpg with some elements of more modern ones.

12690,Hunting Unlimited 2010,"This isn't my kind of game, at all, but I still recommend it. Why? Because, on one hand, it is easy to see exactly what you are getting and whether it is a game for you. Also, on the other, it is very affordable, and, despite not being my kind of game, is actually still kind of fun. The graphics aren't great, to be honest, but aren't terrible for the time when the game was released, and at the same time are probably the biggest weakness, which is saying something. The game is stable with no issues running in Windows 10, has a variety of weaponry and game settings/locations available, and even the mechanics programmed in for animal behavior and such are realistic and stable enough so as to make the experience fairly engrossing. The big downside to the gameplay is that, quite simply, you do need to be the type of person to actually enjoy playing a game simulating hunting. That is, the (sometimes tedious) search for and slow stalking of prey, long periods of simply waiting or slowly crawling into position, etc. If you're the type of person that enjoys more constant activity in your gameplay, then this probably isn't a good choice. On the bright side though, it is a means to go hunting when you're unable/unwilling to do so in real life, and do so for a very low price for what is being offered. Even just the built in shooting range aspect, to get a feel for the various weapons, is far more fun than I was expecting - largely because of the precision targeting and fine tuning of your aim that the game makes both possible and necessary. While the hunting itself can generally be done without quite so much precision being needed, there is a deep satisfaction that comes from getting one's aim just right to hit the most distant bullseye with your chosen weapon. For the price, it's a great choice.",1,0

12750,GRID,"This review is base off HARD difficulty and playing with a G27 wheel.  I read a bunch of review about how GRID is the best out of the series, if this is the best, the series SUCK! First off I'm in my mid 30's and driven on race tracks multiple times and this game doesn't even come close to how it really feels. I understand this game is not a sim, instead a more arcade kinda game.   Couple of problem with the game is none of the cars have any weight to them, they all feel like paper cars. I played Iracing and other racing games with my G27 wheel this game has the worst wheel feel.   They try to make this game hard by doing all the wrong things. Perfect example is Team Raven Crest, instead of making them a challenge because of their driving skills, they instead just give them the fastest car and boosting them a littler more so their car is uncatchable in the category race you're in.  Another thing they do wrong is how cars react when they come in contact with each other during the race. I don't understand why every time you get hit or you hitting someone from any angel you're the one that is spinning out and the AI just drives off fine.   Overall if you never driven a real car before and under the age of 16 you'll think this game is awesome. For anyone looking for a fair challenge or a driving game that is more close to real life feel this isn't it. If you check all my review I'm normally pretty good on recommending games and never really vote no on recommendation, but this game is a total joke.   Save your money for Project C.A.R.S or Assetto Corsa.",-1,0

13140,America's Army 3,"If you're looking for CoD or Battlefield, stay away from this title. If you want standard FPS play, stay away from this title. If you want to charge into battle Rambo style, play this game--but not on my team. If you are curious about military service or interested in a serious attempt at simulating combat where wounds are not typically superficial and team-oriented play is a must, this may be the game for you. It's aging a bit now, and the game's community/development has been replaced by that CoD wannabe pretending to be an America's Army game. BUT this is still a great game. If you try it and like it, you might even see if you can get a copy of America's Army 2: Special Forces, as in some respects I think that was a superior version. The AI on it, some of the training, and especially the special forces training section can help anyone improve their FPS game--regardless of what game you regularly play. That being said, it does have limitations in areas that some other pay to play games do better. However, fewer jumpy Halo types to annoy--either because they're too chicken to play games like this or because they have enough sense to adapt their style to this game.

15100,Assassin's Creed,"Assassin's Creed™ is the next-gen game developed by Ubisoft Montreal that redefines the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change.   The setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict.   You are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.",1,0

15100,Assassin's Creed,"If you have played any of the other Assassin's Creed games before having experienced this one, you might end up disappointed. However I find this game highly enjoyable if you can look past it's flaws, which can be excused by the fact that this is the first entry in the series and the developers obviously haven't perfected it yet.  The controls can be a little tough to manage at times but that's something you can surely get used to. In my opinion the biggest problem this game has are the missions: there is not a lot of variety in them, which can get tiring, escpecially if you compare it to the sequel. However the Setting, music, atmosphere, story and gameplay are all just as phenomenal as the rest of the series.",1,0
15100,Assassin's Creed,"Great game. Great way to open up a completely new series. The game looks good for its time, free running plays fluidly, and the story is very good. One complaint that most people seem to share, although this wasnt an issue for me, was that the missions became too repetitive. I can see how people found that to be the case but if you stick to doing the bare minimum required to move on, you literally cut the busy work in half and shorten the games lifespan to the perfect length. The combat is very easy and its almost impossible to die from combat once you learn how to counter attack but that doesnt take away from the games experience because you still end up running and sneaking from guards for the sake of saving time. The long horse rides from city to city can be a bit of a pain and the games ending is a TERRIBLE cliffhanger that leaves much to be desired but by the time youre reading this, AC2 is already out anyways so what does it matter? This game is a great buy and its a MUST play.",1,0

15210,Silent Hunter III,"It is safe to say that war provides the most popular structure within games, so when faced with the prospect of taking up 'yet another war game', people can be forgiven for choosing to spend their time elsewhere.  Let me contest that idea in relation to Silent Hunter III, or SHIII (coincidentally a sound you might make a lot whilst playing the game). SH3 is set against the backdrop of WW2 (in its entirety), but it is a different beast to any shooter or RTS. The war is definitely going on out there, but you're merely a boat in the ocean and your focus is your orders, your crew and the deep waters immediately out around you. In historical writings this ocean arena is referred to with reverance for both sides playing a high stakes chess game in an isolated battlefield with little of the political discolourings of the mainland.  One of those games to draw you in and hold your attention across many hundreds of hours.  NOTE: the Grey Wolves 3 mod is considered MANDATORY! See subsim forum!",1,0

1530,Multiwinia,"For what it is, I got a fair amount of play out of Multiwinia but it certainly isn't anything spectacular. Actually, it's about as simplified as an RTS game can possibly get. There is only one type of unit, and the only real control you have is to give a vague direction to them. Occassionally you'll use an item or pull off a clever pincer attack, but Multiwinia is very simplistic.  Despite being simplistic, or perhaps because of it, a large chunk of the gameplay is a grind. Send your 100 units to kill the enemy's 100 units and try to stop them from spawning more, so you can send in more and take a base that they can no longer defend. Of course, you'll be sending these units in waves, usually immediately after they spawn. As far as gameplay goes, there really isn't a lot there: you'll end up automating most of your units' movements.  There are a few different game modes but only a few of them really work well. King of the hill and generic base capturing are fine. There's a mode that involves capturing bases to fuel a rocket as well, but it's similar to the general base capturing mode. Another mode features capturing statues and returning them to your base (permanently) and while different enough, doesn't really get away from the base/king of the hill modes much. The last type I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It involves capturing a heavily fortified position. One army gets very frequent respawns while the other doesnt, but as there is little to no strategy in this game, it's very painful to play. The attacking team either sits and hordes units, or sends them in as he gets them. Either way, they almost all die for little to no progress against the defender.  There's online vs and it works well enough, but like I've said, the lack of any unique units or strategy really bogs this game down to a grind and you probably won't have a lot of fun with your friends. It's good for a game or two but after that you'll probably want to move on.  On the plus side, the AI is competent enough that playing against it isn't boring, especially if there are several enemy teams. Watching enemy teams duke it out is quite entertaining.  Oh, some really cool/scary things can happen if the aliens or darkwinians get out of control. ♥♥♥♥ those aliens man, they are god damned ridiculous.  Final note? The way items are distributed is pretty biased. I do like the idea that if you want the items then you have to send units to go collect them because you have to decide whether or not the reward is worth the risk of leaving an area unguarded or unharassed (pro tip: it usually is).  I liked it but I think I'm also in a very small minority of people that would. It's just so basic.",1,1

15300,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"Ghost Recon is one of the all time classics of the tactical FPS genre. I have played this game many times over since the early 2000s, and it still plays great. Even if the graphics are slightly dated, the game play more than makes up for it. You have to be smart and tactical in your approach to combat and as such this game is a rarity nowadays. If you don’t plan the approach, more often than not, you will be spotted and taken out. This is also an open map style game so you can achieve your objectives from many angles, only helping its tactical appeal. Another interesting aspect is the ‘command map’ in which you can control other squads and have them move as a separate entity. Each squad has maximum of three members and you can have 3 squads but a max of 6 total characters. Each of these characters is playable through selecting him or her in the command interface.   This game truly is the pinnacle of the genre so if you’re not hung up on graphics but are interested in realistic combat, then this is definitely the game for you.",1,0

So way to go, developers, you showed us how pointlessly anti-configuration you were for no god damned reason. Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.  As for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it. Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.  Another really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement. That's right, play now or forever have an empty slot in your achievement list. That's some really epic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

15520,AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity,"There isn't anything in this game to hold your attention for an acceptable amount of time. It's fun for a brief few moments, but you'll just be doing the same thing over and over again. It's one of those games which doesn't really grasp the concept that fun isn't enough to support an entire game. Its entire draw is that the core gameplay is fun, but everything else is utterly lacking. There's no story and nothing to hope for as you progress through the game. You won't find yourself wondering if new game mechanics will be added. You won't find yourself wondering if a new upgrade will change how you play the game. You start the game, and then you have the option to keep playing forever. If you're a REALLY big fan of the engine and place no value in your time, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than me. But it's 10 dollars! Don't spend that much money on a game like this! I can personally recommend a dozen flash games that will give you a more rewarding experience. Especially considering that they released a better version of this game which COSTS THE SAME AMOUNT!!  They're trying to fleece you. That's the best way to describe this. You're given a little bit of fun at ten times the price it should be. The product that you're given isn't meant to stand the test of time at all.

1700,Arx Fatalis,"Arx Fatalis is a true gem in the rough. The last time I experienced this specific kind of immersive, oldschool, slow burn atmospheric vibes was when I played Gothic 1 a couple of years ago.   * The mechanics and initial slow pacing take some getting used to and you need to invest some time in it to let it grow on you, but when the world unfolds and your character gets stronger it feels great and you feel right at home within the games setting.  * The story and lore are not the most elaborate ever and voice acting is not that great nor distractingly bad. But the world design in itself is actually pretty original. Level design is very solid and exploring real carefully not only feels very rewarding, it is essential. * Graphically it looks dated, but surprisingly acceptable nevertheless because it renders so well on large resolutions. To me this is still a pretty game. Also the music and sound design are really good and add a lot to the overall atmosphere.  * Do note that unfortunately this game will NOT run without Arx liberatis, do look it up to get it to work. It's not much of a hassle, but really Steam should make sure the games they offer are actually playable right away.

17410,Mirror's Edge,"Mirror's Edge was released in 2007 as one of the first Frostbite Engine games, as a proof-of-concept of sorts. You play as Faith, a runner (messenger) in a futuristic city that can't seem to decide whether it's in America or Asia, with signs displaying both English words and characters. The color scheme is amazing, and the way lighting and textures are handled, I probably would've guessed it was released in 2010 or 2011 based on how good it looks. Faith gets through the city using parkour moves, with the game focusing more on acrobatics than combat mechanics. Running, jumping, sliding, and the other moves feel fluid and not at all nausea-inducing, but fighting is reduced to mashing buttons and hoping you don't die. There are only 3 types of guns, which you pick up off police officers and drop when ammo is gone, but gunplay is minimal in the game. This is encouraged by not being able to do any sort of parkour while holding a gun. I found myself only using Runner Vision (slow-mo) when I really needed to, though mostly just to make long jumps look really cool. I did also find myself accidentally triggering it fairly often. Bugs are rare, having encountered only 2 or 3 in the many times I've played it. TL;DR - Looks great, but you need a higher-end GPU. Parkour is great, combat not so much. Overall fun, and more should be expected from 2015 (?) sequel. More should be revealed E3 2014.",1,0

17410,Mirror's Edge,The best parkour/free running game I have ever played.,1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"A game about running. It cleverly juggles action and puzzle elements. When exposed, the player has to run away to the music of firing guns and shouting policemen. During calmer moments the player has platforming puzzles to solve, much like in Portal, but with wall jumps and climbing instead of a portal gun.  It is set in a postcyberpunk future, in a beautiful and unique city. Its emptiness serves the feeling of isolation, but the story suffers from it. There are no people to talk to, no context to put the protagonist’s actions into. You’re a freedom fighter in a city with no civilians. It’s so painful that those amazing vast spaces are not inhabited. The city is breathtaking on the outside, but lacks substance.  We never learn how constant invigilation affects normal people or why and how the resistance movement works. It’s not even clear what messages the runners actually carry or who do they serve: only the resistance or anyone who pays the money. It’s even less clear why runners are so important for the police to form a specialized unit for hunting them down. We never see any (political or personal) consequence to a runner delivering a package. There are so many interesting questions here that never get explored or answered.  Instead the game focuses on right now and personal. Our charming protagonist, aptly named Faith, breaks into offices and runs around the city trying to figure out conspiracy around a murder that her sister gets unjustly accused of.  Even though this is a game about free running, the progression around the city is pretty linear. Mechanically the city acts as a space to traverse, providing platforms and ledges to climb and jump over. Sadly there is no gameplay support for the backstory, e.g. there are a lot of cameras around the city, but they don’t affect the game in any way: you cannot get spotted or hide from them, they’re just decoration.  In spite of those limitations the core of the game is executed perfectly. You feel each step, each jump and fall. Running around the city is a pleasure: the clear visuals, a fitting soundtrack and the immediacy of movement gives a true feeling of freedom. It’s hard not to feel compassion for Faith. She is a very human protagonist, stubborn yet caring. She hugs her sister before running away again - a sympathetic gesture seldom seen in video games so dominated with violence and power fantasies.  Its innovative mechanics are still blended with a lot of existing game tropes. There are valves to turn, vents to crawl and exploding barrels. Elevators act as an intermission, we have a mission control guy, there are secret packages to find, there is even a bit of shooting. The Icarus Project sounds like a direct reference to the original Deus Ex.  Mirror’s Edge is a great game, but it could have been much more. Time will tell if Mirror’s Edge 2 will turn out to be a worthy successor.",1,0

The gameplay completely changed at the end of the game. It stopped being a fun free run style of game with the occasional take down of a guy or occasionally using a gun to having to use a gun to get past so many situations. Maybe i'm just bad or something, but the last level especially I found to be impossible without carefully taking down each enemy with a gun.

Running around, fighting, and doing parkour all in the extreme first person is rather a jarring experience as everyone is not used to this kind of visual experience but once you get used to it you'll wish Mirrors Edge 2 would be finished faster and question why other games haven't done it. The maps are rather linear in nature but how you go about it can be quite different as you can run by enemies using your parkour skills to evade harm, use your martial skills to take down enemies, or disarm and use the enmies weapons against them or a combo of them all. The choice is yours.",1,0

17410,Mirror's Edge,"Very beautiful game. I love the colors, the contrasts, and the symolism. I like the first person aspects and the free running mechanics but together they can make the game really frustrating.  Game could also be called, 'Or I could Die.' What a sweet jump, or I could die. I'm going to drop kick that guy, or I could die. Still a very good game.",1,0

17410,Mirror's Edge,"Full of plot holes, bugs and not fun in general. Entertaining at most but a nice time killer.  EDIT 1: But why, do you ask.  ABOUT THE PLOT. -There are many points where story doesn't have a continuity (After getting your sister back in both cut scenes 'COME ON, YOU WERE JUST IN PERSIUT') -Forgettable, unbuilt characters. (Seriously, I forgot all the names) -An ending so bland and a game length so short (Where most of the games I take double than this) -Nothing to do after you're done  ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY -Great fluidity and simple controls -Terrible shooty shoot system. -So unawardiing and uncompelling gameplay  ABOUT THE BUGS -EA. Need I say more? -Alt + Tabbing is a gamble with the devil -Random game crashes and freezes  PLEASE NOTE THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPPINION, WHICH IS SUBJECTIVE, SO PLEASE DON'T BE SALTY ABOUT IT.  EDIT 2: Longest review for me  EDIT 3: Apparently lowering the specs should help but this game is so painfully bland it falls flat on the hype. Sure, it was good for the price but I'd never play it again. The only people who play it is my family who wanted a 3D version of the mobile game 'VECTOR' (Not good either, but more stable than Buggysoft's release).   I mean, just look at the ending: You save your sister while waves of poliece officers come to the rooftop and after you crash a ♥♥♥♥ing helicopter at downtown you don't have to run anymore.     BTW, if you think I have a biased opinion, then see my other reviews, they are 100% by the base game experience with no online functions unless required.",-1,1

17470,Dead Space,"Immersive, Impressive, Addictive...the more you play it, the more you love it...  I'm just six years late to start playing Dead Space. I must confess it wasn't my favorite game sytle until last week. So I decided to go through it and here I am: looking foward to go playing through the dead space trilogy...amazing game, awesome details, interesting atmosphere, very good sound effects and cinematics.   The surprising features: 1. The game engine is smooth with loading screens only in chapter transitions; 2. The level design is amasingly perfect and creepy as well; 3. Overall plot is very good and its main and secondary objectives are interesting; 4. There are two mini games on it; 5. Weapons visual, sound, and physical effects are really cool. No standard military weapons; 6. Enemies are creepy and disgusting...but funny to kill; 7. Boss fights are good; 8. There are 'store feature' that allow you buying and selling in game items; 9. Weapon upgrades are enjoyable and worth; 10. In game player interfaces are well developed and animated (cargo lift buttoms, weapon benches, stores, control pannels); 11. Looting system provides well balanced sort of items throughout the whole game (ammo, medkits, money, etc); 12. Zero gravity missions and fights are as awesome as tense; 13. Different sort of weapons provides an interesting replayability. Try only few weapons at a time and see the difference in game play and difficulty level; 14. Story telling is well balanced between direct dialogs and in game information (video logs, text logs, cut scenes, etc).  Overall, the game is still worth playing even at 6 years later. Just play it and have fun.",1,1

17470,Dead Space,"Essentially everything I love about the horror/sci-fi genre is combined in this sanguinary, rancid and entirely abominable onslaught of space zombies on crack. Dead Space is a gore epic that should be played by anyone who has the guts.",1,0
17470,Dead Space,"Solid game, dragged on toward the back end a little bit. Could've easily cut out 2 of the 12 levels, but overall this game does a lot of things right, including great graphics and FEAR-like suspense. Kinda reminded me of Alien a lot with being in futuristic space with scary monsters hiding in the ship. The story is kinda dumb, and they are definately referencing Scientology in the plot which I thought was interesting, but also dumb lol. The shooting which is 70% of the excitement is done very well. It is a third person shooter like Resident Evil, and I am sure this game knocked people's socks off in 2008. For me playing in 2015, it is still relevant and worth playing, but not a knock-out. Game held my attention very well for the first half, and finished just in time before the gameplay got stale.   83/100",1,0

17470,Dead Space,"Dead Space is very close to my heart. I've always been a sci-fi junkie. I believe that I was born too early to explore the galaxy. When I heard about it (a long time ago), I thought to myself: 'Space? Yeah! Horror? Hell yeah! EA? ...' I had my doubts. But when I finally had a computer to play it, the game captured me. First and foremost, the UI is THE BEST THING I've ever seen. In fact, I do believe that it's the future of navigation. Holographic augmented reality. It makes you feel submerged in the game at all times. When you check inventories or logbooks in other games, it kinda clicks off the fantasy in your brain. here, you're always in the game. Second, the graphic detail is amazing. The game has sustained its cruel beauty despite the passage of time. The enviroment really creates the right atmosphere. And it looks great, even in my humble laptop. Finally, the story. It is unique. And is elements made me confront some of the things I was living during that time. It helped me get through them. And it made me see that, somehow, there will be light at the end of the tunnel. Even if self sacrifice is to be made to help others.   Play it. You won't be dissapointed.",1,0

18040,DeathSpank,"DeathSpank is a joy to play. The comedy is great. The items, quests, and other mechanics aren't overly complicated and make this RPG a lot of fun. There are a lot of side quests to complete (I think around 115 quests total including main/side quests) and you'll want to finish all of them.  It's mixture of cartoony 3D and 2D graphics around a curving world is a nice change from typical RPGs. It's also shorter than many others, as it can easily be 100% finished in 10-12 hours. Which, to me, isn't a bad thing at all. It isn't too short, and it isn't so long that you get bored and burned out by the end. If you're a fan of RPGs, I definitely recommend it.",1,0

FC3 was the first I played of the series, and it was outstandingly fun. Yeah, it was a little too action-y, but man, did it have a good story and addicting gameplay.  Then came FC2. WOW! Can't say enough about how good this game is. Love the Africa setting, love the environment you have to survive in, love the weapons, love the challenges, love the gameplay, and that desperate feeling that you're alone in a foreign country and you're trying to survive, and just barely doing it.

19900,Far Cry 2,"Recommend with reservations. The fast travel points are too few and too far in between. That dulls the pace of the game along with the numerous soldier checkpoints.

19900,Far Cry 2,"This game has a lot of exclusive things about it that you don't see in other similar games. If they are out there, I haven't seen them and thus they are tucked away in some indie nameless title. Such as getting hit, having to dislodge shratnel from your arm with rusty pliars, put out fire, ect... and using fire to burn people out of villages, guns jamming, and being able to judge a weapon's combay prowess by looking at it. 'Hey this rusty piece of ♥♥♥♥ REALLY IS A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥!'   Major CONS: Lots of stuff in this game has terrible interaction.

19980,Prince of Persia,"Ok here's go bad thing: The combat is repeatitive, and it's not many time you engage into a combat. The clibing is slow (like 20% slower than normal PoP).

Good things:  +The story is awesome, well, if you slow down and press T, there will be a story for you, and build up 2 characters' relationship nicely.  +The scenery is so nice and beautiful, For example: 25 places to visit in game, all different with each other, but all follow the theme of the zone they are at and it's so magical, in fact.  +Adding 2 things above together with the slow pace movement makes a good adventure game.

200010,Quantum Conundrum,"It took me almost a year to finish Quantum Conundrum. I'm not even sure why because I was really excited to play it. So I pre-ordered it back then, and when it was finally available I played it for 2 hours and then... stopped. I guess it didn't pull me in like Portal once did. That doesn't make it a bad game, not at all. It just lacks that certain charm. The puzzles, however, are pretty cool.   So, I decided to continue the game just recently and I have to say the game actually gets a lot better near the end, when you have access to all 4 dimensions (fluffy, weight, anti-gravity and slow). Switching between them while solving these puzzles can actually be very rewarding. It's a great feeling. And while the game lasts only about 6-7 hours, it's long and challenging enough to keep your attention (for most of us anyway ;)).  Now that QC2 has appeared in the Steam registry I'm actually really excited again (edit: I guess this will never happen since the studio closed) !  I ♥ first person puzzle games.  [Rating: 86/100]",1,1
200010,Quantum Conundrum,"What can I say? It's a fun first person puzzle game, and having John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation) provide his voice made it so much better. There are a lot of parallels to Portal but that is because this game was made by Kim Swift who made Portal. She even came up with the idea for Quantum Conundrum while she was working on Portal. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix. One of the downsides is that it was a little short, about six, seven hours to beat (I wasn't doing a collectable run). Overall it was fun, witty, and callenging, everything I look for in a game.  9/10 would science again.",1,0
200010,Quantum Conundrum,"At times it's actually more of a first-person platformer than a puzzle game, and the physics are actually pretty lousy for a game that depends on physics so much. For example, your character appears to have no momentum of his own, so if you jump while standing on an object, you suddenly stop in mid-air and fall. It's somewhat disappointing and makes the puzzles more frustrating than necessary to solve.",-1,0
200010,Quantum Conundrum,"The implementation of this game's mechanics was a disappointment - the puzzles often feel unnatural, and the gameplay lacks focus. There is fun to be had, but the game wasn't inspiring enough to keep me pressing through the high difficulty curve - 6/10",-1,0
200130,Puzzler World 2,"Is this game bad? No. But it does have problems. And you cannot not compare this to the first one. The puzzles are still here, and mostly good, but the new ones that they added aren't as good. 'Backwards' is effetively a combination word search and crossword puzzle that becomes trivially easy once you realize that, on a computer version, you can just black out the entire board and then erase the words. They altered Fitwords so that you can grab and drag words onto the board, which is very useful... when it works. They've updated a lot of features, made the resolution bigger, made Link-a-Pix be a scrollable window now instead of trying to jam everything onto one screen (a change I didn't like a first, but it is growing on me), they added a Master mode with harder puzzles once you've played through enough in Challenge mode. They added a trophy room. There are problems with Picture Quiz where some of the answers are subjectively wrong (for example, asking you to count something in the picture, but the answer is only from one portion when there are others visible elsewhere). And, the biggest change from the first, this one seems to be locked in UK English. So, for the American audience, there are going to be spelling errors and references/phrases that don't make sense. All in all, if you really like these kinds of puzzles, and have already burned through the first game, then yea, pick this one up. But if you haven't finished the first, stick with it. You'll be glad you did.  Further information: The game contains some fairly serious bugs. Typing in '0' while in a Sudoku game will break the UI and render Sudoku unplayable until you restart the game. In Master Mode, you can't scroll past the first 16 puzzles, even if there are more available. You can click below them and get extra puzzles, but only four of them. This means some puzzles, and thus some in-game trophies, are unobtainable.",-1,0

Try not to get frustrated when you (inevitably) die several times before you can move past an area; quite often the death scenes are just as entertaining as the puzzle itself!   You  must  resist the temptation to read any sort of walkthrough or watch any Let’s Play videos…  at least until after you’ve beat the game. All of the fun of these games comes from the challenge of figuring out the puzzles. If you start reading hints online, you will inevitably spoil something for yourself, and once you know the solution there’s no going back.

Even though I can play almost any game, I feel that I would have to force myself to get through this one. If I wanted to play a game similar to this, but better, I would play InFamous. Yet, I can not complain too much about the game. The idea and upgrades are cool. It's fun if you want to cause complete chaos with your overpowered character, but that's it.",-1,0

There is so much wrong with this game, i continued to play thinking surely it must get better, but honestly, trust every other review when they say this is the worst game ever.   • The voice acting is terrible, i've heard more heart felt believable conversations with my pet cat. Voice acting isnt a make or break for a game but still its a major minus.   • There is no story!!! Im on a holiday break, the hotel is named after a dead mountaineer, it has a museum room which was once his. Ok. Some one's been smoking in the room and there are some shoes which dont belong there. Hardly a case for Scooby Doo. Then thats kind of it, you spend the entire game following idle tasks with no story, no reason other than to advance the game. then when the end does come you simply dont care.  • It's really slow! You walk everywhere, there is no option to run, even in a hurry 'Quick, we have to get guy on the roof here because his friend is badly injured, slowely walks to roof.' there are some scenes where you can double click and fast travel through the room without having to actually walk the entire room, but yea this plays really slow and clunky.   • You will not care about anyone. I didnt even bother to learn their names, i really wanted this to be a good game, i thought from looking at it a steam sale that it could be good, but no, coupled with the bad voice acting you find yourself unable to connect with any of the characters.   There is a plot twist at the end. at least if there was a plot, there would be the twist but for me and my experiance, it was the beginning of the story, which then ended some 2 paragraphs later. And while im on it, as a plot twist its utterly wank.   Buy this game only if you have played every other game on steam... and only if it comes on sale for £1... and only if you get that £1 from someone else.",-1,0

105100,Lume,"The art style is nice, but the game itself isn't worth seven bucks at all. Puzzles go from really easy to impossible without a guide, and there's only like seven puzzles in the entire game. You could beat it in less than an hour, even if you got stuck. Spend your seven bucks on something else, like one of the dungeon keeper games off of GOG.",-1,0
105600,Terraria,"Before you say 'OHLEHLTHISISTOODHEEMEINCRAFT'... let me stop you right there. Minecraft SUGGESTS you to play this game, sir. Read some of the splashscreens. It says 'Also try Terraria!', and notice there's also 'Don't bother with the clones!' Yeah. THINK before you say 'LEHLMEINKREFFTKNEKEFF', k? It's a very good game, the only thing I didn't find pleasant was it not being steam overlay-friendly. Hell, even the NEGATIVE reviews are actually POSITIVE reviews! Very good game, I give it the Medal Of Approval.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is the first and by far most polished game in 2D sandbox exploration/building genre.  Aside from expected core concept of mining for resources and building your house or settlement, Terraria puts stronger emphasis on combat – particularly epic boss battles – than most other games of this genre. There are a lot of challenging bosses to fight, each with their own fighting style that requires specific tactical approach. And depending on how well you are equipped, regular enemies can pose a constant threat, especially in the areas that are meant to be hard. There is also a huge selection of weapons and magic spells (that act just like weapons, but require mana for each use) available to the player, most different from the others not just in damage they do, but in how they work in general. So the combat mechanics is very good when it comes to both enemies and the player.  When it comes to environment, Terraria has a fair amount of different biomes, each of which is very well-designed with unique enemies, treasures and atmosphere. Terraria also has very interesting Corruption/Crimson/Hallow mechanics that is currently unique among the games of this genre. Corruption, Crimson and Hallow are biomes that spread over time, consuming other biomes, and keeping them contained (if you make it your goal) can be a real challenge in the Hardmode, where few things can halt these biomes’ growth.  If you enjoy 2D sandbox exploration/building genre and somehow missed Terraria, you should most definitely give it a try! And if you haven’t played the games of this genre yet, Terraria is a solid choice to get familiar with it.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I'm writing this review with 450-ish hours put into Terraria. I don't write reviews often, and usually when I do, it's to let people know I accidentally purchased something awful, and to warn them from making the same mistake.  But Terraria's fun! It's good! It's even what some might call charming.  Two-Dimensional procedurally generated world-conquering/colonizing. Pixel-building/Pixel-Art. Guide Voodoo Dolls. These are just a few of the 'features' Terraria has to offer. And as someone who's played from beginning to now, let me tell you, the Guide Voodoo Doll REALLY IS a feature. I remember how much anger and table-flipping he used to cause me, and still does from time to time... You'll never get tired of dropping his doll in the lava, even if it does summon giant walls of evil flesh with wormy mouths that pop off and try to eat your face. Oh yeah, that's totally a feature too, killing the Guide to start a boss-fight.  This game knows exactly what it is and makes no attempts to convince you otherwise. It's 2D Minecraft. It's Minecraft if Minecraft had a better combat system, more content, more mechanics it could work with. Mods might alleviate some of the mellow nature of a game like Minecraft, but it'll never stand up to Terraria in combat. And Terraria knows it'll never stand up to Minecraft in the 'Turning random things into beautiful art-pieces' space. And that's okay.  Because while Terraria knows it's 2D Minecraft, it also knows it's not at the same time. With a much stronger focus on gearing up for fights than just for the sake of it, Terraria quickly begins to make itself stand apart the first time you fight one of its many bosses. From Cthulu's Eyeballs and brains, to the revived metallic skeleton that probably housed them, to EVIL EFFING SPIDERS WHY DID YOU ADD THOSE RELOGIC to towering Golems, there are a whole whack of bosses to fight, and a whole whack of sub-bosses and special bosses to find and fight in-between.  It's a much more customization-friendly game too, designed to do what it can to help each player try to stand out from their friends in-game. The King Slime has your precious Ninja Outfits guys, but good luck with the farming, you'll be at it a while. I'll stick to my Jungle Rose in my hair thanks. But don't think that flower in my locks makes me weak, not ever since they added visual armor slots. Ya never know when Santa might be wearing full Adamantite armor... It serves him well to do that too...  Because sometimes, even the world itself tries to kill you. Goblins, Pumpkins, Turkey's, Snowmen... A few different invasions, and not all of them are normal things...  Did I mention the game has seasonal events too? Like finding snow and candy-canes around Christmas-time, Pumpkins and Turkey's during the months before... I wonder if we'll see something Easter-themed this year added? Hmmmm...  And lastly, ReLogic does keep tabs on this game. Official support ended a long time ago... And then came back... And then has been kind of in the wind, with ReLogic taking their time, but you know, supporting a game like this with genuinely massive content updates, minor patches, User Interface fixes and streamlining, re-balancing, new bosses, biomes, gear, special blocks and decorative blocks and craftables... This is a game that sees more than its fair share of love, not just from its community, but straight from its creators, too.  Terraria is a game that I keep coming back to over and over. It's a game that the very creator of it himself just can't quite manage to stay away from. Give it a shot, and maybe it'll be a game you keep coming back to over and over again too.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"I am in love with this game I have spent over 3,000 hours on this. I own a server and its been up for nearly a year now and I don't regret ever doing it. The Terraria community is amazing.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I've never been in an abusive relationship before. As a strong, empowered woman, I'm proud to say that about myself. I have self-respect. I have independence. I know how to establish emotional walls and judge when someone is being cruel to me.  No, Terraria isn't mean to me. Terraria just tries to teach me lessons. It punishes me when I'm stupid - I deserve it. Terraria warned me not to go obsidian farming in a cramped tunnel after three hours of ore collecting and spelunking. It said 'baby, don't do that, you're going to die from lava somehow.' And I said, whatever, I got this! I'm on a roll!  And then the lava came through the water above me somehow, and I died. And all of my equipment was lost.  This was before I realized your equipment is only recoverable if you DON'T log out immediately in a rage after dying. You have to suck it up and get back down there.  I can't count the number of times I've run furious into dark tunnels because my lazy ♥♥♥ didn't put torches up, fumbling around looking deep in the bowels of the earth with a recall potion half-corked and ready. But I get my gear back, every time after that.  And every time I get uppity, Terraria is there to hit me (gently, in the face, multiple times, until I cry) and remind me what a stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ I am, and how I just need to learn my place and stop trying to go underground so much.  Terraria loves me. It gave me fairy wings and powered armor, and a shark machine gun that shoots homing green bullets. I love Terraria, too. You just don't understand Terraria like I do. What we have is different.  Terraria can show me such tenderness, except when it's eclipsing and shoving hordes of swamp monsters and vampires down my throat, even though I'm begging it to stop because I'm running out of ammo, because I thought a pile of 2,000 would be enough.  Terraria always finds ways to ♥♥♥♥ me over and make me say 'thank you, baby.' Oh god. I need to get away from this game.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"This is a really great 2D, action, adventure, sandbox game. Before you allow naysayers to make you doubt buying and enjoying this game, consider all the positive reviews first and make sure you gave it a fair chance.  When Terraria was first released, I myself had been a Minecraft player. So as you can guess my first thoughts about it were, 'Someone made a clone of Minecraft?'. However, instead of leaving it at that I decided to actually look into the game and eventually bought it out of curiosity for its 2d side scrolling and simplistic design. I found that Terraria although small when it was first released, was a very fun and addictive game. As the game has received a vast amount of updates the content has changed greatly. It has become a well thought out and a finely crafted game. ;)   On a serious note, this game has many features and a variety of content I don't think you will find readily anywhere else in this type of game. You can easily play this game for hours solo or with friends, generating worlds can be wildly different, and to obtain some items you may even have to generate 2 or 3 worlds just to find them. I don't want to spoil anything but please note: You can easily get through the game without having the items that all possible worlds can generate. I mainly want to emphasize that you can play new worlds and continue the adventure. After playing this game for many months I quit for a short while, when I returned to play again, the updates allowed me to create a new world and a new character, and still enjoy the same parts of the game I had played in the past, but now with new mechanics and items and even new npcs.  Aside from my personal experiences with this game here are some Pro's and Con's.   Pro's:  Lots of content for hours of play. Solo or Multi-player options. Tons of items and materials. Many npcs and in game events. Smooth combat system. Creative bosses, monsters, and npcs.   Con's:  As the world is 2D, buildings tend to be simple and square at first, but can be fully developed thanks to placeable items and back walls. (Check out the screen shots for some awesome builds) The world only generates once based on the size you pick, leaving a finite ammount of materials for one map.  Screen shots are a pain to take and paste together to show off large buildings.  (Developers have revealed a new update, allowing for larger screen shots. Yay!)   Overall there is a lot of content for this game, many items to craft, monsters, and more planned updates. If you like to build, this is a great game with many options to build marvellous structures. If you like to adventure with friends, this is a very fun game to take down bosses together, and build better weapons and armour with the resources you find and earn.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review for Terraria, I hope this helps you make the right decision for you, and that you are happy, which ever way you should go. :)",1,0

Terraria is kind of like a 2D minecraft, except the focus is much less on survival and more on fighting enemies, exploring caves and biomes for cool loot. The combat is endlessly fun, with a huge variety of enemies and bosses with different AIs, alongside a range of weapons and armour. Especially fun with friends, the worlds are very large and building possibilities are also endless. I will love and recommend this game to my death. am hard 4 et",1,1

You can pick and choose how you wish to progress throughout the entire game and can literally go about unhindered on your journey no matter what you do, heck, you can even get some of the best stuff in the game by fishing if you choose. With the world being different with each and every play, you can't just 'see' it all in one sitting. With many furniture items,paints, and blocks, you can build a fortress unlike any other, or if you like, gardens, homes, and parks. There's just too much to do in the world of Terraria.",1,0

Intriguing boss fights and invasion events that require you to prepare beforehand as to not face impending doom right off the bat. The maps are huge and hide many secrets.

105600,Terraria,One of my favorite games to this day. Great to play with friends and you can work alone on your own server and collect items to help out when you join multiplayer again.

105600,Terraria,This game was one of my first games on steam and was purchased so i could play with my other steam friends online through there game. I like every thing really in this game but then again i love minecraft and this game is really simalar but different at the same time. I would definitly recomend this game to those of the gaming comunity that like the minning and sevial type games as it is kind of all these things in one. You learn straight away what is bad and what is good ai and there for u know what to fight and if u haven't already checked out the sky above i sugguest that u find a way up there and accross as there is another world again and also don't be afraid to explore the world below. This game is quite a challange for some when first starting out but be brave and keep trying as there is always something else to it. With multiply levels of play it is suitable for anygamer not just kids or teenagers.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"'It is definitely worth picking up if you can afford it.'  this game, is impressive. I have played 412 hours of this game probably encounting if I ever get back to it. I have played through this game multiple times, never really got through the entire top of the gear tree. I stopped at the second last set i believe. I didn't really touch it when 1.2 came out, but im sure they didn't remove much just added alot more.  I like the art style, its simplistic but everything is quite small. The way the game starts is as any sandbox survival does these days, grab wood, build a house, mine for ores. But then something happens. The game starts to go slightly over the top and adds things like a laser pistol, crazy glowing swords and magic. I mean the first boss you fight is a giant eyeball that turns into a mouth on half health. You will get through dungeons and biomes. But then this game added something called hardmode, which you fight the 'Wall of Flesh', and then the world becomes really difficult and has unicorns and fairies try to kill you.  Thats the basics of the game, its quite light on graphic options and a simple game to run, so you don't need anything powerful. Its also moddable and amazing if you like 2D sidescrollers and survival sandboxes. It is definitely worth picking up if you can afford it.  8.5/10",1,0

Also, there are quite a few NPC's which you could buy and sell from. You can make a house out of rainbow bricks, clouds, hellstones, your choice to choose from hundreds types of blocks.

105600,Terraria,This is the best Sandbox andventure game there is so much to do i have played 60 hours and still have not touched the tip of what you can do.  Pros  1.Alot of items 2.alot of monsters 3.exciting combat 4.You can transer your charter from world to world So you can play single player then go play with freinds 5.alot of bosses 6.it runs well on crappy pcs  these are just the ones i could think off  cons 1.being able to bring your charter from one world to another causes alot fo players to cheat then go on public servers this causes people to make servers that you have a locked charter on 2.Terria deveipers said they are not going to be putting out large updates any more but they will havea small team still deveolping 3.ok i cant think of any others.  I would say if you are even looking at buying this that means it is a gonraw you like just go for it. Its worth the 10 dollors EDIT:it gets boring after you kill all the bosses but that takes a long time,1,0

105600,Terraria,"Here's a short explanation for what this review is gonna be: comparing Minecraft and Terraria, to show Terraria's pros and cons, while staying spoiler-free for everybody.  Gameplay:  Both of them are fantastic, although you should choose Terraria if you like more action and adventure than Building and crafting (Though there is still a lot of that in Terraria), both have amazing feelings with exploring.  When you find a good cave, you can delve in it right at the start with some torches, and fight off the enemies like Zombies, Skeletons, and Slimes. You can mine Lead, Gems, Tin, and much much more in Terraria, providing more ores than Minecraft. And MUCH MUCH more items. There's about 2000 items in Terraria, so you won't stop discovering for a while. (And building in Terraria is still pretty important so you can keep getting NPCs to buy from and etc.)  Overall, I think Terraria wins in Gameplay.  How easy is it to get into:  Both really need a wiki open if you want to get anywhere with crafting and etc, but Terraria is stronger. Thankfully there's a Guide NPC that'll show you what you can craft with certain materials, no matter how much of the item you have. In my opinion, Terraria is harder to get into because the crafting isn't as obvious without a wiki.  How hard is it:  Terraria is definitely more difficult, with an Expert Mode, Hardcore characters, and more. But, you can still play Normal, Softcore or Mediumcore characters, so the difficulty is pretty flexible, though the first nights are still pretty brutal, especially if you get unlucky with some events. But, Terraria is a GOOD difficult.  Terraria is balanced, so it gets the edge.  Multiplayer:  Honestly, you really need to get some friends and play through this game together, for the FIRST time. Terraria is really something you should experience with others, and with Steam Multiplayer, it's even easier. I also reccomend to not play with classes on your first time, it's way too complicated. While Minecraft stills deals with I.Ps and everything. (As someone who hosts Terraria Servers, it isn't too laggy, just make sure you play with someone near you.)  Length:  Terraria is the longer game with Gameplay, but Minecraft is the longer game with building. Terraria can get a little boring after you finish killing all the bosses on Normal and etc, but Expert and Challenges, and Classes are a thing for that to not get as boring, while Minecraft has massive mod support, huge fanbase, and a lot of fun servers to play with people on.  In my opinion, they both tie on this.  Modding: Minecraft. Simply, Minecraft.  Okay, that's it for now, I hope that was helpful, I might add more to this later on. And by the way, in MY opinion, Terraria is better than Minecraft, though their both absolutely great. I own both. :)",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria builds on the same formula that made Minecraft a huge success, although it s focus clearly lies on combat and game progression rather than sandbox-building. The possibility to freely play with any of your characters on any world and the fact that you can easily make any of your worlds accessible for multiplayer and play together with your friends makes for countless hours of fun. You can even design your own PvP arenas and battle it out with your friends. Don't let the apparent similarities to Minecraft deceive you; although it uses the same formula, it's a brillant game on its own. I've personally played it for over 200 hours already and will certainly add at least 100 on top of that, with the new, massive update coming today.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Definitely a game to buy. A ton of content, randomly generated worlds, a lot of opportunity to let your imagination go wild, this game has it all. Personally, I'd say it's a game better off played with friends, but it can be just as fun when you're solo.",1,0

105600,Terraria,One of the greatest games I've ever played. Game never gets old. Love it.,1,0
105600,Terraria,Terraria is one of the most fun games I have played it is a fun survival and 2d game. I think terraria is a better game then Minecraft because there are way more bosses Tonz of wepons that havee diffrent styles and Way more monsters. You get to make your OWN player and do much more fun things. This game is fun solo or with some friends. You can also make cool buildings for your self or NPC's. You can Buy or sell things with NPC's wich makes it way cooler then Minecraft you can go deep in caves and fine minerals you need with abandon mining houses with loot and there is also mine tracts you can follow. the there is the Under world Aka Hell you can see for your self of that is. I think terraria is worth $9.99,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Extremely addicting, good soundtrack 11/10",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria. How to define this game that brought me a new vision?  Terraria is one of the best sandbox games ever made.The graphics aren't very good but they cativate the player the first time they see it.   The NPCs aren't very helpful in the beggining, but they are always there.As you proceed in your journey, they show to be more helpful, and there are always new NPCs as you progress in the game. The Crafting Stations. There are many of them in the game, most of them are for crafting furniture, but they are really helpful. Exploring. Exploring is very important in the game and also very rewarding. One of the best aspects of the game. The Weapons and Armor are incredible. They were made in a way that every weapons and armor are different from the others. Also, class separation by armor happens. Each armor for each armor. Last, but not least, the Boss Battles.They are AMAZING and very fun.Besides being rewarding(especially when you play it in the expert mode)they are hard and challenging. Every boss is creative in its own way and different from the others. Another good aspect of the game.  So, my opinion? Terraria is a great sandbox 2D game, that brings you a incredible and different experience in the gaming aspect. Should you buy it? I recommend it to anyone and everybody, because it's a different and fun experience. It's really a great game.",1,0
105600,Terraria,Great game although i dont advise buying it if you have little patience.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"There is SO much to say about this game.  First off I'll say its probably #2 on my favorite games list. Its kinda like Minecraft except in 2d. But in my opinion, Terraria takes Minecraft off the list. Terraria has awesome bosses, other types of ores, (in my opinion) better house building, and etc etc. I could go on for quite awhile talking about how awesome this game is.  It is definatly worth the 10 bucks even though I got it for 15 when it came out XD. Still kinda mad about that. Anyway, in conclusion, this game is the BEST survival game ever. GET IT!!!!

105600,Terraria,This game really shines in the fact that every world is different. Also you can transfer characters to new worlds! This is nice when youve done everything and don't want to start from scratch. I knocked off 1 point simply because the game being 2D limits some aspects of gameplay. It still works very well for what it is. I know everybody says this but it reminds me a lot of minecraft. It also has a lot of great and unique differences. I highly recommend Terraria.

105600,Terraria,"Oh man...words cannot express what happened to me after eating these. The Gummi Bear 'Cleanse'. If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy. If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!  First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5. So good. Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.  BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.  Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.  But wait; there's more. What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincters were screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.  AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.  I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day. There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.  I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.  Silly woman. All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened. I think she was crying.  Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating. She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left. She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc. Lots of people who generally have limited access to toilets on a given day. I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day. I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.  If you order these, best of luck to you. And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks.  PS: When I ordered these, the warnings and disclaimers and legalese were NOT posted. I'm not a moron. Also, not sure why so many people assume I'm a man. I am a woman. We poop too. Of course, our poop sparkles and smells like a walk in a meadow of wildflowers. Thanks for all the great comments. I've been enjoying reading them and so glad that the horror show I experienced from snacking on these has at least made some people smile.",-1,1

After it's release on X-Box One some of my friends have gotten into this game again and I noticed significant changes to the game world, backgrounds, more crafting items and vanity items.

There is an INSANE amount of content in this game, with aspects of adventure, action, and creativity as the game progresses, One of the best things about the game is how replayable it is, with each time you replay it giving you a different experience depending on what you want to do. Many people may consider similar it to Minecraft (I do in fact like Minecraft), however, it is a far more polished game with better and more extensive conent and gameplay. Although the game has a slow start, you really get into it as you collect more resources and weapons, and are able to defeat continuously harder bosses to progress.

The game is very fun to play with a strong sense of adventure, exploration and progression through the various weapons sets and armour. You can play as a warrior, wizard/mage or ranger type of character, or a mix of all three if you want to try out all of the different styles with one character. You can also enjoy the building element of the game and there is great fun to be had in designing an awesome base in between all of the adventuring and exploration you'll be undertaking in your randomly generated world.  You can get hundreds of hours of enjoyment from Terraria and the developers are still producing updates for the game. It is also worth noting that the music in this game is exceptionally good and the style in general is excellent.

105600,Terraria,"I have just over 15 hours on record, and I haven't even scratched the surface... In fact, I am so early into this game's content that if this was a horror movie, I only just woke up from that dream where the monster (that totally doesn't exist but I will later find out it actually does) catches me. The monster is still coming, I can feel it in my bones (giggles commence) and boy is it gonna do a number on me.....   Definately worth anybodies while.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"There's one word to describe this game... and that word is amazing. The singleplayer mode makes every hour playing it worth it, and once you build that Terra Blade, you feel like you own the world.  But then I played Multiplayer...          ...and Terraria was even more fun. Playing with people you know and sharing the experience of surviving just makes it that whole lot better.  So, in short, 10 dollars for this game? I'd be happy to pay 100.  (Not literally, plz dun do dis Re-Logic)",1,0

105600,Terraria,"This game may not look fun in the beggining (you are alone , there is only one npc, you have no idea of what to do) but once you start gathering resources, exploring, etc. you will notice that this game is a piece of art, it has great music, a lot of bosses, more than 3000 items (look how much time i have been playing this, and i can tell you that im still discovering items) and with the last update, terraria got even better! you really need to get this game if you like sandbox, building survival, crafting, rpg (not full rpg but it has a little of it(very little(almost nothing))), magic combat, weapons, sniper riffles, and portal guns!",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I see no ending to this game. You might fight the final boss, make the final things, and think its over, but yet theres still more to be done. Theres classes, theres expert mode, theres patience, and some of the things you may not expect, like an entire army coming for you. There is nothing you cant do on this game, i mean, what other game lets you shoot out rainbow cats out of a sword?",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This game is endless when it comes to things to do. Fight an eyeball with a mouth? Sure. Fight a MECHANICAL eyeball with a mouth that breathes fire and has a rapid laser shooting twin? Yes. Just go up to a dungeon and kill some random cultists that just happen to be there and then have some crazy lunatic guy start flying and summoning dragons to eat you? Of course. And at the end of it all save the world from the destruction of Cthulhu's brother and do it so many times that he eventually drops a Nyan Cat sword? You got it. The game's got far over 3000 items. And it's got something for everybody.   Whether you want to just be some guy who kills evil slimes with a laser rock (Last Prism) or a guy who ventures deep into the depths of the jungle and destroys the queen of all evil plants with a copper shortsword, you can do either. (I've yet to do either of these things, but something about them needs to be swapped with the other.) If this has not persuaded you then maybe being able to fight corrupt serpends or giant floating brains or a floating skeleton with no legs or gigantic bee swarms or a demonic wall of flesh or a mechanical worm or a mechanical skeleton or a golem or four floating star pillars of doom or any of the other hundreds of monsters in this game.  Some complain that Terraria has many things left to work on. And that games like Minecraft are better. They have cooler things. Like a third Dimension. Well.  -Terraria only needs two dimensions to be awesome. -Terraria didn't sell out to Microsoft. -Terraria has more than one kind of flying creature, or in some cases more dragons. -More items more mobs more bosses more more more more more more more more more more MOOOOOAAAAAR. -Jetpacks Wings Magic Shoes (?) AND FREAKING DYE FOR ALL ARMOR? -Other games (ok you know i mean minecraft by now) DON'T HAVE FURNITURE -No lag in Terraria  In conclusion, you should pay 30 bucks on 4 copies of Terraria and give it to freinds and not on Minecraft only to be suprised by all the buy Realms stuff and countless server ads to buy this and that and all the things. I hope that I have persuaded you and I know this review is very long but I have gone through the trouble of writing this so that you can get a good game and Re-Logic get richer.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"PROS: -SO many SICK and fun weapons! and like 9080983291732819 items -You can craft different armor, potions and weapon combinations to fit your own playstyle. (Kinda like a class system that you can change) -Tons of fun, challenging bossfights. (Seriously, there are like 30 different bosses) -RPG+Survival (Like Minecraft) combination, which is really fun and you can build a lot of things. -Unlike many other RPGs that I've played, it actually requires something other than just grinding. It requires creativity (Building and getting items), thinking (To cleverly choose weapon combinations and build your class) and strategy (To kill bosses).  CONS: -Not enough tutorials in game. It will probably take you a long time to learn the game and you'll have to use the wiki a lot and maybe play with a friend.  Overall: Terraria is a fun, smart survival game with RPG mechanics, a lot of crazy fun to use weapons, SO MANY items and bosses and the building adds a lot. Overall rating: 9/10",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Sometimes referred to as “2D Minecraft”, this game has a lot to offer and although similar, Terraria has more than proven itself undeserving of that title. From the joyful music and visual style, Terraria has earned its praised, and is simply just a whole lot of fun. If you’re thinking of getting it, do so! Its easily a game worth your time and money. The single player is a fun stand alone adventure that begins with a simple wood/stone house, to your character casting head first into the underworld full of demons and oceans of magma! Multiplayer is just as fun, and, maybe even a little chaotic. ;)  The makers of Terraria are also working on a new game entitled Starbound. It’s worth keeping an eye on!",1,0

Just make lots of rooms. Try out the game!",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria. Such an awesome game. Never thought i would like it, but i have got so addicted to it that iv had nightmares. Its a simple game, but can also make your day bad. I have had crashes where parts of my house of disappeared or loot vanished from a chest. Mainly due to the crash whilst playing multiplayer with My Geko. Other than this, i have a good deal to say about Terraria, If you do not own this game...buy it! This game is so addictive especially in single player that i have unwillingly neglected some friends i promised to play multiplayer with, its unsually til the next morning that i realised i had forgotten about them because i was having so much fun by myself. In some cases if you prefer playing this game alone, i have no problem with that. It might take you a while longer to get to where you want to go, but once you are there, ther reward is sweet. (Not that i know what sweet tastes like just yet) I have seen what is possible on Terraria, and even though i may not have got that far myself...When i do..Im going to suck that candy cane dry!

But then as you figure out how things work, you become stronger and more in control, because you create your own objectives (No need for quests... pff.)  Terraria is a game about defeating bosses and grinding for epic loot (Now, haven't we heard that before?). But still, it's a very unique game. First of all, the complete lack of a storyline. It's a RPG make your own story. Second. The crafting system, there are about 4000 different thing you can create. Third, the combat and different creatures. A LOT of variety.

105600,Terraria,"When I hear people talking about games with sprawling worlds in which the player can create anything he or she wants, comparisons to the groundbreaking (badum tss) Minecraft are inevitable. Terraria successfully distances itself from Mojang's hit game while retaining most of the aspects of Minecraft that made it a fresh look at the tired formula for open-world games. The first thing to which Minecraft aficionados will have to adjust is the new two-dimensional perspective. This might seem restrictive of what players can create at first, but I found that it makes the game less daunting. It also allows for platforming to function a lot more smoothly. This game might look simple like a Super Mario game on the surface, but its RPG-like depth reveals itself as you play. Non-player characters will move into your game world, which allows you to sell the treasures you found while tunneling through the randomly generated caves littered throughout the world. Terraria masterfully blends platform games, RPGs, and terraforming games into one package. My only noticeable complaint stems from how the game is pretty ambiguous as to what you are supposed to do. Craftable items only reveal themselves once you have collected the necessary materials, and I only found out that Iwas supposed to be stopping some kind of world-devouring evil from online forums. Some people may enjoy that lack of handholding, but I thought it was slightly off-putting. Nevertheless, this game is phenomanally deep, once you know the ropes.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"After about 2 hours: Great game, gets boring just digging for caverns, but once you find them it is cool. Well worth the money.  After 200+ hours: I cannot believe the amount of hours you can play this game for the $2.49 it cost me in the Steam Summer Sale. The newest update added many more hours of gameplay. Once you start playing multiplayer, many more hours accumulate. There are a lot of entities in the game, and it is very difficult to keep track to them at first. Use the wiki available to find out about any part of the game, you'll find that the huge amount of weapons, blocks, mobs and boss challenges mean that the game can be played for hours on end, without crafting the same weapon or fighting a same boss twice.",1,0

105600,Terraria,Lots of people think this is another Minecraft copy but in no way is it just another copy. Terraria is much more of an action game than Minecraft.

105600,Terraria,"It's not minecraft. More arcade, more ambience, better music, less creation, less exploration.   Very enjoyable with friends.

Definitely recommend this game, especially at the sub $20 (or sub $10) price.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is an excellent game in the vein of Minecraft.

105600,Terraria,"On the surface Terraria may seem like a mere 2D clone of Minecraft. While the two do share some similarities Terraria is very much its own beast. While Minecraft's focus is on building whatever you can think of, Terraria challanges you to survive in it's world. The monsters the game throughs at you are numerous and deadly, where even something as lowly as a slime can kill you easily if your not properly equipped. Even the landscape can feel like it's against you, especially in the Corruption where massive chasms spell doom for anyone who falls into them, again, unless you are properly equipped.  I keep saying 'properlly equipped' because that is what Terraria is really about: the hunt for sweet loot. From swords larger than your body to a half-shark-half-minigun, the weapons and armor you can find and build are amazing. You can kit yourself out in many different ways, such as warrior that wields boomerangs and flails or a magician who also carries guns and explosives to take care of his enemies from afar. With that said Terraria does share one of Minecraft's biggest flaws: it doesn't tell you much. A Guide NPC will be there to give you basic info and show you what you can craft with different material, but some things like where to find certain drops or how to summon and defeat the bosses is left up to you to find out. Thankfully there is a helpful wiki just a quick Google search away to help you with anything you need.  In the end I'm sure you all are asking 'Which one is truely better, Minecraft or Terraria?' My answer to that is this: If you love building all sort of things on your own, play Minecraft. If you'd rather fight a giant flying eyeball to the death with a lightsaber and a laser gun, play Terraria.",1,0
105600,Terraria,This game is da bomb,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Obviously, when people look at this game they are immediatly going to compare it to minecraft. Once you get past the blocky aesthetic and mining, the games are actually quite different. Instead of focusing more upon building, Terraria is more concerened on creating an adventure. The game is full of different areas to explore, as well as unique mobs, ores, bosses, weapons, rpg elements, and much much more. This game basically takes minecraft's dull adventure aspect and amplyfies it by 100. However, the game isn't a complete replacement for minecraft. Personally, I prefer building things in minecraft over terraria. The 3-d environment of minecraft makes creating buildings much more satisfying than the 2-d buildings in terraria. Don't get me wrong, you can build some pretty impressive things in terraria and the game has many more different matterials to build with than in minecraft. I could not get into building anything more than a simple log cabin in the game, but that certainly doesn't its not a good building system. It's just different than what I prefer. If you were to ask me if I were to recomend either this game or minecraft, I would have to ask what you are looking for. If you want to get sucked into a new world and explore it I would pick terraria over minecraft any day. If you want to build, go with minecraft. I can't personally say that one is better than the other. I rate this a 9.5/10",1,0

105600,Terraria,"So, if you were to ask me to write a review for Terraria, and say whether it is a good game or not, I can't answer that. What I can answer however is how much I like this game. For me, (sorry Minecraft fanboys/fangirls) Terraria is better than Minecraft in every way possible. For some reason, I really like the 2D art more than the 3D block style in Minecraft, and also the soundtrack is so much more creative and diverse then Minecraft's simple repetitive theme. Honestly, you should already have this game, and if you are considering buying it, stop reading this review and go buy it. It is loads of fun with friends, and by yourself. The only thing is sometimes multiplayer is derpy, but that can be forgived.  Verdict= 9.5/10  GO BUY IT",1,0

Speed up like Sonic with your Hermes Boots, swing your sword like Link with a heavy selection of blades and legendary swords, or be like Ness and collect all the yo-yo's. Whatever path you choose in Terraria, it matters not. Will you keep it simple at an easy pace, or will you destroy the evil creatures throughout the world, or will you build a home for you and your NPC's, or will you defeat the guardian of Hell, and curse your world for eternity... or will you just play the game already?",1,0

105600,Terraria,"2D version of Minecraft. But better in every way. Still you have griefers but you can summon Skeletron to ♥♥♥♥ their ♥♥♥♥ up. Creating a character is simple but needs more things like glasses and hats. You can even go to hell to fight the Wall of Flesh or go to the Hollow, which is heaven in this game. Whatever you had on your character in one game can be put onto another. Yes, there is guns in the game as well.

105600,Terraria,"Terrraria is very fun to play. It has a massive selection of blocks that you can choose to build your underwater unicorn lava castle floating on clouds with. The game has a ton of fun exploration and could be very challenging at times. Singleplayer is very fun to play but the more I have played the game, the less I found it fun. When you reach the 'end' of your item collection or building your dream world you have nothing else to really put time and effort in other than create another build.  The game could be so much better with a steam-multiplayer intergration. Playing with friends is always more fun in games and especially with sandbox games like Terraria.  If you are searching for a sandbox game that has almost not limits in what YOU want to do, then this is the game for you!",1,0

105600,Terraria,"A nice sandbox game that keeps the Player going for more,to strive towards the end. The bosses are a challenge, but then there's preperation.

105600,Terraria,Insanely difficult bosses when you get to mid game. Very enjoyable with friends and I love the fact you HAVE to have multiple worlds created to succeed.

105600,Terraria,"tl;dr there's more to do after end game if you want to continue playing, if not you got your moneys worth!  800 hours and counting, the game might get a little boring/frustrating at times...For example  *When you inevitably stop making progression for a period of time, long or short (I feel like it happens to everyone, or maybe I just suck because it seems to happen to me fairly often even after playing for 800+ hours.)  *When you can't think of what to build (I always just look up other peoples builds, to break that builders block, spark some ideas)  *When you build your houses/builds and realize they didn't turn out how you thought they would so you end up starting over (This blows, but I just take it as motivation to build something bigger and better)  *When you can't get something to drop. (Welcome to rng)  *WHEN YOU CONSTANTLY DIE OVER AND OVER AND CHRIST STOP KILLING ME, I JUST WANT TO FARM COINS FOR ONE MINUTE.  *And finally, when you beat the end game boss, but hey guess what, that's not the end! What else can you do once you think that you're finally done? You've finally broken free of your curse and can see the outside world again? Well...  ** Unlock all of the achievements! It's semi difficult and time consuming, but personally I think it's extremely rewarding (I don't even have it done because I can't stand the angler, but I'm working on it)  ** Make a collection! Collect all the items, put them on display, show them off! You've earned it!  ** If you're looking for a challenge play expert mode, on a mediumcore+, expert mode is great and it adds some expert mode exclusive loot!  ** Challenge yourself by trying some challenges!  (http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-challenges.1778/)   ** Work with wiring, it's interesting and fun.  ** Start over (or not) and play multiplayer if you already haven't, this game is beyond amazing with friends, like unbelievably amazing with friends. Also tie some mods into it! (I'll get into that later)  ** Finally download some mods, I've recently just started playing terraria again, and downloading mods totally resparked my interest. I did a mostly full playthrough of the 'The Thorium Mod' (Haven't beat the post-end game boss yet) and had a blast, and guess what? That mod is multiplayer compatible! (Along with many more I'm sure) So download it and some others and give them a shot, by yourself or with friends! I just recently made another new character with a few more mods this time around, and I'm having a blast!  So pretty much, even after beating the end game boss there's more to do IF you want to continue playing, you've already got your moneys worth at that point so if you want to put the game down feel free, no one will judge you for that. But remember, if the sun burns and you want to keep your pearly pale skin in tact, there's more to do!",1,1
105600,Terraria,I just can't stop playing this game.,1,0
105600,Terraria,"Words can’t describe how fun this game is. It just becomes more enjoyable each hour... and with each boss killed. Even if you finish the game multiple times, I’m sure anyone would still find something new to do. The first few hours may be boring (I think it’s boring, personally) but after some time you realize how great it is. The developers did a great job on keeping the game alive with new content every few months. It really does have a lot of content and they are now working on Terraria: Otherworld.  If you have friends to play with it’s even more fun. Also you can speed up the progress by playing with them, which is always good. The 1.1, 1.2 and the 1.3 updates were the biggest updates to the game. If you played the game before ATLEAST the 1.3 update, you know how much content they add to the game. Even if you started playing the game after the 1.3 release, you will notice the huge amount of content.  I had lots of fun playing this game and the hours put into it was well worth it. I might not play it ever again but since I have lots of other games to play I just don’t have time for it. At the end, it’s great and I’m SURE 90% of the people on steam has this masterpiece in their library. If you don’t own it, what are you waiting for?! It’s really cheap and well worth every penny.  10/10",1,0

You can use a drill mount (locked for only the best of the best), you can (obviously) use a pickaxe, or you can fish for ores. The variety of ways to do things, the countless number of enemies and NPC's kept me wanting to play on and on. There is a point where you want to stop, but for me, it took a long time.

10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"If you love: ALIENS, Marines and Predators (no notion towards the films Aliens or Predators) then you will love this, being a fan of the original Aliens Versus Predator classic and AVP2 games this game truly holds its own.  Levels are pretty repetitive in the design sense since the entire campaigns link together in a strong bond, but it’s a good repetitive point to make, go invisible as the Predator, climb up the walls as an Alien (exnomorph) or fire your pulse like you mean it as a Marine.  Now only if they used this engine to make Aliens: Colonial marine, just saying… Gearbox.",1,1
10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"I have not played this game in some time mostly because I have moved on to other games but not because I thought this game was in anyway bad.  I am writing a review now even though I have had the game a few years mainly because of its recent return for sale on Steam and that it seems to be getting negative reviews alongside Alien: Colonial Marine and questions as to why it was removed from sale.  Having owned and unfortunatly now lost the first AvP game, I was really looking forward to this newer DX11 boasting game and true to form I was not disapointed. Graphically intense and baring in mind this came out as DX11 games were still fairly new, the effects really stood out.  This version however imo is far more graphic and scarey compared to the original and it feels more true to the movies then previous attempts. There are small flaws but not game ending flaws and to be honest they were not really worth mentioning in this review.  Like the previous version you have three storylines to choose from: Marine, Alien and Predator, and each has its own storyline which like AvP2 has certain crossover points which make the story more interesting.  I have never been a fan of the alien storyline in all version of the game but found immense enjoyment with the Predator and Marine.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  As a final note, I never played this game on multiplayer, but I have become aware that this is no longer active for what ever reason. I would not be put off by this as the single player element has more than enough content for you to cover.",1,0
10680,Aliens vs. Predator,Better than Colonial Marines.,1,0
10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"The game sure did improve with its looks and controls but single player mode for all 3 species is a bit exiciting through your first play through, but after that its just a big meh for me.  Multiplayer takes a REALLY long time to get used to for beginners really because of most the people who have been playing for awhile are nearly experts at the game. I don't play alot of multiplayer simply because of that reason.  To conclude this, I'll say that this game is only $15 and it won't hurt to try it out.",1,0
10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"Play as the marines, aliens or predator in this updated version of the classic '99 AvP. The marines campaign offers the standard FPS game, you are given a motion sensor which will aid you in tracking where enemies are coming from. The Predator plays a bit more stealthily, you can cloak yourself to be invisible to humans but can still be tracked by aliens. Also your infrared can show you locations of the marines but not the aliens. You can distort and distract the marines to allow for easier takedowns. The aliens has no ranged attacks but they have the ability to move about freely anywhere on the map. You can climb walls and ceiliings get places you wouldn't even think of. Might be hard to find some online multiplayer games, but the campaigns themselves are well worth it.",1,0
10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"Play as a Marine, Alien or a Predator! Each play significantly different with their own pluses/minuses for each race.

10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"The original AVP was great, had a lot of scary moments and aliens were legitimately scary as they came in countless numbers. This re-imagining of the AVP turns it on its head a bit and makes aliens more durable, less frequent and altogether un-scary.  On a positive note, it looks great and controls well for the most part. Fans of Aliens will enjoy some tie-ins and cameo(s) to the series.  AVP 2 felt like the series at its peak.",-1,0

Being able to choose which weapons you liked and upgrade them accordingly lets you play the game how you want to play. Highly recommended if you want a solid good game.,1,0
107100,Bastion,"An unexpectedly nice indie game with a nice sense of platform-like gameplay.  A story that travels you into a place and time out of the ordinary, with very well designed characters and interesting RPG elements and very friendly gameplay. The music some times is really nice and the whole story wins you. However it is very short, way too short to even complete most of the skills during one game play.  Enjoyed it very much and totally recommend it. Most def worth buying during an offer since I can't say the price of €13,99 is what you should give. I also didn't buy the soundtrack since there are like only 2 very nice actual pieces out of all OST (and you can enjoy them to the max on youtube anyway) - Better do it if you feel you wanna support the creators.  Short but overwhelming experience. Thumbs up",1,0

107100,Bastion,"Bastion is a game that every Gamer HAS to play.   Let me explain something: I don't normally play or like games similar to Bastion. I'm not a fan of action games like this, even if they have a lot of depth in combat like Bastion does. What makes me like this game so much, then?  Its the unique method of storytelling. There is narrator who narrates everything that happens as you play, commenting on plot events or things the player does. Sometimes, he just fills in the lore during downtime. This narrator also has an 'epic movie' kind of voice that makes it fun to listen to. Essentially, Bastion puts a new spin on storytelling, and it is really clever.   Some other great aspects are the beatuiful art styles of the game and the way the world builds around as you walk through it. Also, it has a wonderful award winning soundtrack (it definately deserves it!)  The gist of the game is that the world of Caeldonia, some sort of flying city, suffered 'the calamity' as was wrecked. You play as 'the kid', one of the few survivors. What caused the Calamity? What was it? How do you fix it? Did anyone survive? Play to find out. There are even a few points where you have to make a tough decision that influences what happens next.   As far as combat, it can be repetive. But take that with a grain of salt, since action games are supposed to be like that and I'm not an expert on it anyway. It seems fluid and responsive enough, and while it isn't clever or groundbreaking, it isn't bad either.",1,0
107100,Bastion,https://www.twitch.tv/thelyano/v/64349548   That Experience throughout the game. Couldn't believe it's 5 years old yet!  A Rare Masterpiece - difficult aswell if you like to.,1,0

107100,Bastion,Spent 2 hours on the main menu listening to music. 10/10,1,0
107100,Bastion,"Holy balls this has quite an AMAZING and FANTASTIC story. Simply put, this game should be in your library, and if it's not...You're only shortchanging yourself. Plenty of challenge for those who like it hard, and just enough give and leeway for those who like it enjoyably easy. Tons of weapons, challenges, perks, customization and zippy one liners about the combos you choose to employ throughout the game. The narrator is quite possibly my favorite character, even over the actual character you play.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"Might not look much at first glance, but give it a go and you'll be suprised. Really good game.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"The atmosphere of this game is very cinematic and enjoyable. I recommend not only the game, but the soundtrack!",1,0
107100,Bastion,"I aquired Bastion through the recent Humble Indie Bundle. The thing is, though, Bastion isn't a game that should be humble. There's so many things that work to make this game excellent. The art style is absolutelty superb, delivering some breathtaking artwork. The soundtrack is well fitting, and can tense moments all the more tenser. Gameplay itself is fun and addicting, constantly taking out baddies to earn more 'fragments' so you can upgrade your weapons and take out MORE baddies.  Yet, the thing that throws Bastion over the edge of greatness, is it's story. The story itself is one of hope in a time of despair. The plot itself has several minor twists, but avoids Bioshock-level revelations, still leading to something interesting.  So the story is what makes it great, right? Well there's something about the story that makes it great: The storyTELLING. The entire game is accompanied with a narrator (Who sounds amazing), who constantly provides insight on things going on.",1,0
107100,Bastion,It is kind of a short game but a lot of fun,1,0
107100,Bastion,This is one of the most refreshingly unique games I've ever played. I couldn't event stop myself after I beat it the first time.,1,0
107100,Bastion,"So far (I'm only like halfway, I think) a really interesting story which seems to become bigger and bigger as you go on (which is rather impressive xonsidering it begins with [SPOILER ALERT] the apocalypse [SPOILER ENDED]). And there's nothing wrong with the old-style arcade-esque gameplay wither, it might not be advanced but it (fondly) reminds me of my old xbox version of Gauntlet which consumed hours of my life. The art style is beautiful and has a heavy influence on the mood which only helps the character feel more a part of the story. Plus -sorry Morgan Freeman- it's got the single best narrator voice I've ever heard. Highly reccomended.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"The game is original in everything. The Story is great with the narrating following the characters movements. The choice of weapons to fight with / block with and the choice of upgrading them. Including the practice of weapons / shields and such.  The music reminds me almost of the tv series 'Firefly' giving it a Steampunk/Fantasy feel to it. The landscape is amazing how it just appears for him as if he is writing his own story as he goes.   Controls (Choose your own keyboard / mouse) would of been 9/10 but manage to change it suit myself so i wont use potions every time i block. So its 10/10 Music in sync with the events, environment and narration, and not sounds good, not at all annoying after a while 9/10. Graphics clear, original and easy on the eyes but eye popping with each new event, like a standing behind a bull and kicked in the nether region. 9/10 Overrall Gameplay &amp; Enjoyment 9/10 - -1 because kept rolling off the map, but that's my fault :P  And only have played it for 2hrs still going.",1,0
107100,Bastion,"I do not recommend Bastion, if you want to experience a worthful story. Basically you have to find Cores and (after that) Fragments to build the Bastion up, for that, the game throws you into different independend (by times short, but beautiful designed) locations where you have to fight through enemies, grab the main item and leave again.  This kind of presentation gets repetetive quickly.  Bastion has its strength in its fightning System, which is really extensive but suffers from the problem that the player can easily skip the combat just by rolling through the levels. Its far quicker and more valuable for the player in most cases. Yeah you don't have to do this, but this option alone makes it to a problem of the game design.",-1,0
107100,Bastion,"narrator's vocal cords are made of love and precious metals/10  but seriously, this game's great. combat feels nice, movement's fluid, story is phenomenal, soundtrack is unparalleled. pick it up whenever you can.",1,0
